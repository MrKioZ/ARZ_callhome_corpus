ar_4150.scr-1259.66-1267.18-B1	It is not a problem for her but it is a problem for Ashraf; she found me actually someday in Almonataza; she found me greeting Ashraf; and
ar_4150.scr-1265.89-1267.47-A	and she's standing in the middle and all
ar_4150.scr-1267.79-1280.53-B1	Yes I mean of course she realized that Yousry; is aside in the middle of the middle one mm! he got out of the consideration so what is important is that they got reconciled but what happened next is that Doha; when he found there is many quarrels he postponed the engagement
ar_4150.scr-1272.13-1273.22-A	yes
ar_4150.scr-1280.88-1281.64-A	who is this

ar_4150.scr-1291.73-1303.56-B1	yes, he felt he might break up after engagement so he decided to postpone it; so all of Alexandria right now are saying that (()) and Quraitam don't fit each other and that they broke up the engagement
ar_4150.scr-1292.44-1294.04-A	yes
ar_4150.scr-1304.82-1306.65-B1	that's the story around the city
ar_4150.scr-1306.17-1308.21-A	and so the operation seems to be ending
ar_4150.scr-1308.97-1317.92-B1	What! No I swear, I mean after this dispute, between you and me, the guy was treating the girl miserably, he wasn't paying attention to her and didn't care about her, he would even spend maybe a week without seeing her and asking about her.
ar_4150.scr-1309.07-1310.40-A	background
ar_4150.scr-1317.31-1323.94-A	and why would they get engaged why bother being with each other

ar_4150.scr-1330.99-1342.13-B1	So of course, I asked him how? I didn't ask him about the engagement ring, I said to him: "Hey Charif, what are you doing?", he answered: "I'm going to eat with my fiancee", I asked him: "What fiancee? you took out the engagement ring!", he said to me: "Yeah! I forgot it, I must go and put it on", so he's basically living his life without the engagement ring.
ar_4150.scr-1342.65-1345.31-A	I seed that there is no need I mean
ar_4150.scr-1345.52-1349.39-B1	i think it won't last for too long between them, but they're a bit better now anyway

ar_4299.scr-1029.49-1040.90-A	I feel guilty in arabic I feel guilty to leave someone that I promised or not I mean promised on the condition that if you're okay with it then okay so I'm feeling guilty that I can help someone and..
ar_4299.scr-1038.76-1045.00-B	I'm not okay make it my own fault and I'm responsible in front of god that I'm not okay with it

ar_4299.scr-1058.31-1065.90-B	God is forgiving and you didn't commit a big crime or so if you read news papers you will know
ar_4299.scr-1065.94-1070.62-B	what the guys do now and the men and so but God keep us away from these things
ar_4299.scr-1069.49-1074.07-A	OK the guys do what they want but each one and his conscience
ar_4299.scr-1072.30-1082.44-B	I'm saying that your conscience won't bother you to the extent that you'd kill yourself or
ar_4299.scr-1082.79-1093.62-B	put all the bad deeds of the world on your head all what has happened is that you met a girl and for some reason you went apart and you're still at the beginning
ar_4299.scr-1094.61-1099.64-A	Okay I understand this very well but god is there
ar_4299.scr-1096.53-1107.98-B	also if you feel really guilty compensate her financially or anything and god will make her meet someone even better not like you even better

ar_4299.scr-1109.64-1111.88-B	no god is the most merciful
ar_4299.scr-1110.59-1112.11-A	the one of us is afraid of God
ar_4299.scr-1112.92-1124.13-B	God is merciful and if you have a mistake pray and ask God for forgivness and give her money and everything you done nothing I mean a great crime
ar_4299.scr-1125.52-1125.92-A	yes but
ar_4299.scr-1125.50-1133.79-B	all that is you are split of someone its better than having a ki or two or ten or a dozen then split and the kids are victims

ar_4299.scr-1168.30-1177.03-B	We want people just from our standard we do not want a millionaire nor a miss of beauty nor this nor that but a girl that has a family to speak with has a family to talk to has nA-
ar_4299.scr-1177.23-1185.84-B	mi- mi- From a family that is good for example m- her reputation is good what is the reason are you a sinner or --

ar_4542.scr-262.59-265.05-B	but in what
ar_4542.scr-263.07-266.18-A	why is the Muslim generation not satisfied, Muslim generation not satisfied

ar_4542.scr-271.14-271.47-A	OK
ar_4542.scr-272.75-273.42-A	(static)
ar_4542.scr-272.62-280.29-B	and write admission I agree to enter first year kindergarten and that school don't have to enter next year in first class because he is six years old next year
ar_4542.scr-280.47-284.33-A	so what's their problem with that, why is it a problem
ar_4542.scr-281.03-281.35-B	what should be
ar_4542.scr-283.90-293.62-B	they're complicating it, it's been bothering me since we got here and we got here I went to apply for him in KG 1 but they said that the semester has already started and it's not possible, so what I'm going to pay the expenses so let him in
ar_4542.scr-291.64-291.88-A	mm
ar_4542.scr-294.79-295.52-A	mm
ar_4542.scr-293.97-301.22-B	there is no places I came and I have someone as intermediate and I brought a letter from the director of administration to make him enter again the second year nursery and the resilt will apper in the first of August
ar_4542.scr-301.26-301.60-A	M!
ar_4542.scr-301.49-309.03-B	they called also to say you have to sign a sanction saying that he starts at KG1 and we're not responsible for him to start primary school so what do you think
ar_4542.scr-309.00-309.49-A	(())
ar_4542.scr-309.12-312.16-B	Ayman has already been accepted in Al-Zeini and I paid the fees
ar_4542.scr-311.76-312.74-A	okay so now..
ar_4542.scr-312.35-317.10-B	and I told them that he has five years brother and you can take him as last year of nursery
ar_4542.scr-317.13-317.46-A	mm
ar_4542.scr-317.72-323.28-B	they told me they agree I mean because of the circumstances and like this they will take Arabic, Math, English language it is Alzeni that is located by our residence
ar_4542.scr-323.17-323.72-A	yes yes
ar_4542.scr-323.96-327.30-B	and then get out to go to a junior school
ar_4542.scr-327.47-331.98-A	yes I mean both cases he is going Alzaina and their kindergarten
ar_4542.scr-331.04-331.51-B	yes
ar_4542.scr-331.57-334.81-B	so I don't know what do you think
ar_4542.scr-334.59-341.65-A	I swear to God there as if circumstances happened maybe he gets first year junios if not here junior and that is it all alike
ar_4542.scr-342.57-343.58-A	I mean if we
ar_4542.scr-342.80-346.24-B	the difference will be from seven hundred to one hundred and fifty
ar_4542.scr-347.21-355.10-A	the idea is not the monty, the idea is that there is a barrier, and he shoul enter first grade
ar_4542.scr-346.90-349.58-B	yeah
ar_4542.scr-354.72-359.21-B	But you will make him join the first grade seven years old so what about
ar_4542.scr-357.37-360.93-A	no if they didn't accept him next year I'll take him to another school
ar_4542.scr-361.44-366.80-B	I mean if the intermediary would work a- I will pay him the expenses to join KG one
ar_4542.scr-367.18-369.53-A	I mean you try first anyway
ar_4542.scr-369.16-370.17-B	okay if it didn't work out
ar_4542.scr-369.83-372.31-A	I mean of they ..
ar_4542.scr-370.50-372.87-B	you know that tuition has to be paid before school
ar_4542.scr-372.77-378.61-A	let me finish, if he gets in first preschool, he has to finish the second too
ar_4542.scr-375.12-375.43-B	yeah
ar_4542.scr-377.78-381.56-B	he'll have to go to KG 2 except on one condition
ar_4542.scr-380.02-380.40-A	yeah
ar_4542.scr-381.51-381.92-A	yeah
ar_4542.scr-382.08-388.65-B	and if a place was made vacant like a kid pulled out because he's traveling or someone took his child out of school
ar_4542.scr-388.75-390.01-A	they'll transfer him to KG2
ar_4542.scr-389.10-390.69-B	that is of course a condition that..
ar_4542.scr-390.65-391.61-A	they'll take him to KG 2
ar_4542.scr-391.96-393.00-B	yeah this year
ar_4542.scr-393.09-393.55-A	yes
ar_4542.scr-393.66-400.28-B	And also the issue of the first grade also I mean the issue of his being joining the first grade next year also if if there is something like that
ar_4542.scr-401.69-406.91-A	I mean if he continued if he continued then he might continue in KG one all the year long and then join the first grade if there is a vacancy
ar_4542.scr-407.11-415.00-B	Yes but there is a very very weak possibility so why they want me to write an endorsement so that they give up their responsibility so that you do not come and ask them how would not he join the first grade
ar_4542.scr-412.24-412.70-A	m
ar_4542.scr-415.19-418.74-A	OK so so consider this intermediary and end up this issue pay ((fi)) some extra money
ar_4542.scr-418.03-419.59-B	OK this favoring didn't work
ar_4542.scr-420.07-420.33-A	What
ar_4542.scr-420.36-422.96-B	Would I let him join KG one in it or what should I do
ar_4542.scr-422.99-425.00-A	I mean let them pay extra money a little its not a problem
ar_4542.scr-425.39-425.86-B	what
ar_4542.scr-425.77-427.66-A	make them pay a bit extra it's no big deal
ar_4542.scr-428.13-434.53-B	they are I wish the issue like i say I went first to get him to first year kindergarten and pay him allowance if God wants so that he don't go
ar_4542.scr-433.47-433.76-A	m
ar_4542.scr-434.79-435.16-A	yes
ar_4542.scr-435.06-437.68-B	didn't accept they are complicating it a lot I don't know what is this
ar_4542.scr-437.85-440.50-A	Yes! this is ((cadathum humma il+waHidIn illi fi))
ar_4542.scr-439.89-445.93-B	If the person knows that before we come back we would have Ha- they would have paid for him and reserved him a place but we did not know
ar_4542.scr-445.90-447.87-A	How could we have known that it is gonna be going this way
ar_4542.scr-448.00-448.33-B	Yeah!
ar_4542.scr-448.33-451.31-A	{breath} <English I don't know> I cannot
ar_4542.scr-451.03-456.46-B	So this way uh! if he did not join the first grade next year then we would have to make him quit and join any school
ar_4542.scr-457.01-462.29-A	Yeah I swear keep him at them till God helps and we find him a solution
ar_4542.scr-462.39-464.46-B	So we make him join if the ((walad))
ar_4542.scr-464.03-467.21-A	Perhaps till we come we find him a solution or something
ar_4542.scr-467.66-468.02-B	m
ar_4542.scr-468.02-471.82-A	I mean if we let it go for now there will be an issue we won't know how to enter it
ar_4542.scr-472.18-472.57-B	yes
ar_4542.scr-472.62-476.45-A	but now he has a place there now if we find him another way to squeeze him in anywhere it'll be alright
ar_4542.scr-476.96-477.61-B	how I mean
ar_4542.scr-477.92-481.34-A	you don't understand me I mean if him being in a school is an advantage
ar_4542.scr-480.92-482.94-B	yeah I mean he has place
ar_4542.scr-482.89-488.91-A	there is an issue to enter the next year a little easier you come and enter it from the start I mean
ar_4542.scr-489.13-491.30-B	what if they insist that I sign this sanction
ar_4542.scr-491.12-492.87-A	you'll have no choice but to sign it for him to get in
ar_4542.scr-493.33-493.63-B	yeah
ar_4542.scr-493.65-499.79-A	but you have to try as hard as you can that you don't sign this sanction and suggest to them the possibility that he get in even if you have to pay
ar_4542.scr-499.14-501.58-B	this whole thing is really bothering me
ar_4542.scr-501.12-505.23-A	of course it goes without saying make them the offer even if you have to pay once or twice it's no problem
ar_4542.scr-505.63-506.01-B	what is this
ar_4542.scr-506.16-509.77-A	I mean offer them to pay them a thousand pounds and that is it I mean make them a thousand
ar_4542.scr-510.97-519.55-B	they wouldn't accept he's Sunni man one of those Islamists this Al Said he's a fraud
ar_4542.scr-520.00-523.18-A	! Yes who is their president, who know him, means nothing ((Hadd))

ar_4751.scr-380.52-387.12-B	so you can adapt to the atmosphere there you must come back even once every two years
ar_4751.scr-383.09-391.45-A	it is it is I try if God wants I mean if God wants we try to get in the coming time I mean
ar_4751.scr-387.83-400.51-B	mm god willing
ar_4751.scr-392.11-401.77-A	god willing but that's the point I mean other than that I'm doing good here  I mean not bad
ar_4751.scr-401.26-407.45-B	I'm telling expatriation is here and there also, but like you said just one month a year
ar_4751.scr-404.35-413.25-A	yeah the period the period that, you the first period when it was hard has passed you know
ar_4751.scr-411.15-414.90-B	yes yes of course
ar_4751.scr-413.65-418.79-A	the exams and the headache and the roaming about and such, thank god
ar_4751.scr-418.05-422.04-B	thanks God
ar_4751.scr-419.37-429.34-A	Yes, thank God. And thank God, one is good, but the idea is like you said, the expatriation...
ar_4751.scr-428.63-437.07-B	There are people want to go to USA, and whoever lives in USA wants to come... You know how each one thinks...
ar_4751.scr-430.09-443.17-A	Yes it's like what you said... What in my mind is that i want to come to Egypt or anywhere. My idea is to live in a country
ar_4751.scr-443.13-445.62-B	[static] ((niDIfaB))
ar_4751.scr-443.29-452.43-A	This means what! this means you do not feel expatriation in it tiHi- this means your country is your country <English anyway> even as you said you stay in Suadi; Arabia; although it is an Arabian country and everything but you feel expatriation right
ar_4751.scr-452.20-456.46-B	Yes! sure sure and maybe more than America, maybe more m-
ar_4751.scr-452.98-458.13-A	It's your country... i don't know my age, mama
ar_4751.scr-457.52-461.71-B	here homesickness what, here homesickness is tough
ar_4751.scr-459.52-465.91-A	I mean OK I didn't go to Saudi but the idea I know that being strange and your country is your country if God wants what ever it is
ar_4751.scr-465.89-475.64-B	yes a big difference
ar_4751.scr-466.52-479.17-A	Where is the place where you feel that you are in your homeland among your friends and your family and your people and so on {breath} so this is just the whole idea anyway and regarding yac- do not consider it from the financial side anyway
ar_4751.scr-478.61-480.77-B	Mmm!
ar_4751.scr-479.20-485.72-A	you see we say God make it easy if God wants in the future if God wants if God wants he will settle in Egypt
ar_4751.scr-484.26-494.40-B	To come while you're comfortable and have possibilities and money to start investing in Egypt, and to be fine and live in a good clean place
ar_4751.scr-487.44-496.07-A	Yes! May God make it easy, God's willing
ar_4751.scr-495.99-503.32-B	We all seek for that at the end so we could live a good life, because Egypt is a beautiful country, but you need money
ar_4751.scr-498.28-506.11-A	OK you have a pharmacy Hussein in Egypt
ar_4751.scr-506.20-510.46-B	my pharmacy is weak Mohamed I mean
ar_4751.scr-508.63-511.10-A	it was not done means it was not done
ar_4751.scr-510.74-516.03-B	it won't get you an apartment or a car or whatever I mean it can just make a living for you alone
ar_4751.scr-514.96-516.03-A	okay you have an apartment
ar_4751.scr-516.78-522.39-B	I know right but still..
ar_4751.scr-520.81-523.23-A	So you have an apartment... huh
ar_4751.scr-522.50-533.01-B	So, you want to... work and dream of a bright future and to buy and bring all what you wish for... you work hard now
ar_4751.scr-530.79-535.49-A	Mmm!
ar_4751.scr-533.08-545.61-B	so that you can rest afterwards but if you rested now then what if you want money for a project to get your son married or any other projects it'll all need money
ar_4751.scr-545.88-546.21-A	Mmm!
ar_4751.scr-545.90-550.96-B	where are you gonna get it I mean the pharmacies won't help
ar_4751.scr-549.60-556.76-A	But right now I mean, the place didn't get any better, you don't feel that it's.. What! didn't you work on it ? aren't you the one who opened it  ?
ar_4751.scr-555.34-560.77-B	I mean it's better thank god, totally better, I mean it totally dropped down when I  traveled.
ar_4751.scr-560.58-560.89-A	m
ar_4751.scr-560.89-567.11-B	and then it started getting better again, I mean with its profit, you can buy a house in Egypt.
ar_4751.scr-566.73-568.92-A	but you won't be able to save up anything
ar_4751.scr-567.91-574.90-B	But it can't guarantee the future, I mean any drug store can be sold for like around seven hundred pounds.
ar_4751.scr-574.99-575.75-A	m!
ar_4751.scr-575.80-577.37-B	she'll be nice
ar_4751.scr-577.38-577.94-A	how much
ar_4751.scr-577.99-580.30-B	of course this thousand Pounds are a lot
ar_4751.scr-579.50-581.05-A	In a day or month?
ar_4751.scr-581.22-583.36-B	per day as sales
ar_4751.scr-582.18-584.58-A	1000 pounds yes sales
ar_4751.scr-584.12-584.98-B	one thousand Pounds in........
ar_4751.scr-585.24-585.88-A	yeah
ar_4751.scr-585.57-587.23-B	One thousand Pounds per day is good
ar_4751.scr-587.39-587.86-A	yeah
ar_4751.scr-588.19-591.20-B	it'll earn you around 6000 a month
ar_4751.scr-591.44-592.31-A	yes
ar_4751.scr-592.20-598.41-B	it's reasonable you'll spend 1000 or 2000 or something and save up the rest this way you're going the right way
ar_4751.scr-598.70-599.08-A	yeh
ar_4751.scr-598.98-607.47-B	so there are those pharmacies in the city center it costs quarter of a million and half a million those prices are normal in Egypt now half a million or a million
ar_4751.scr-607.34-607.67-A	mm
ar_4751.scr-607.86-613.75-B	you go to hear those prices but if you want to buy a pharmacy in a bad place you can have it for 50 and 60 thousands as you like
ar_4751.scr-613.92-616.65-A	Yes! but those pharmacies...
ar_4751.scr-614.93-618.46-B	you see I mean in new Tanta he wanted to sell it for half a million
ar_4751.scr-619.27-620.49-A	New Tanta that is where
ar_4751.scr-621.36-623.23-B	on the Sea street next to Ganat Al Fawakeh (sells drinks)
ar_4751.scr-622.43-625.44-A	yes, the one by the side of the road
ar_4751.scr-625.11-626.12-B	next to Fawakeh Al Ganna
ar_4751.scr-626.46-628.74-A	yes correct in Tanta, he wants to sell it for half a million
ar_4751.scr-629.28-629.77-B	yeah
ar_4751.scr-629.85-631.76-A	but it's location is very good
ar_4751.scr-630.74-634.04-B	he earned a lot from it, and is bored now
ar_4751.scr-632.74-636.30-A	It's place is good, the place is good, yes!
ar_4751.scr-634.98-638.33-B	Me? yes of course beautiful i tell. You deserve it
ar_4751.scr-637.48-639.62-A	yes yes no its location is good

ar_4751.scr-646.32-646.67-A	m
ar_4751.scr-647.00-649.68-B	and afterward you may come back and live a comfortable life
ar_4751.scr-648.55-652.73-A	there are a lot of other investments besides the pharmacy
ar_4751.scr-651.99-656.05-B	I'm telling you about the worst that we know about , a project that we ...
ar_4751.scr-654.98-667.02-A	I know what you mean, but I think it's possible that  two or three partners with a certain amount of money can start a good company
ar_4751.scr-665.07-669.03-B	We make a company ya- maybe sure
ar_4751.scr-667.81-679.21-A	You make a company instead instead of paying half a million for a pharmacy shop so three or four can make like three or four million pounds then you open a company or you open an office and import medicine from anywhere
ar_4751.scr-679.09-681.07-B	Well I hope we all come back and do so
ar_4751.scr-681.19-682.20-A	{breath} hopefully

ar_4949.scr-166.22-170.80-B	Hala; knows the reason given that she called me but Yasser; it is not my business
ar_4949.scr-171.82-177.86-B	{breath} The important thing basically is that he did not talk to her about anything, I mean she was happy about her next day morning

ar_4949.scr-311.39-317.31-B	whatever so I told him you've never asked me whether me or the kids want anything
ar_4949.scr-317.74-321.47-B	and when you see me going out at night me and the kids for some bread
ar_4949.scr-321.69-325.55-B	you've never offered to go yourself
ar_4949.scr-326.27-329.01-B	you never asked me if I needed anything or if we are doing all right

ar_4949.scr-356.90-363.63-B	I was I mean having issues with me and I called her and said I am at the station I am at the golf
ar_4949.scr-364.71-372.24-B	and then Hoda tells me, yeah and what's with me taking the car a lot I told him no dad I don't take the car out for no reason it's all work
ar_4949.scr-372.67-379.59-B	go and ask a traffic officer when does this car pass by here he'll tell you it passes at 6 and get back at 9.30
ar_4949.scr-379.91-385.28-B	go and ask the traffic officer at the Golf he'll tell you it passes at 7.30 and get back at 10.30
ar_4949.scr-385.95-389.60-B	you don't say that to me, he said it's Hoda
ar_4949.scr-390.40-400.70-B	some guy said to him your sister wanders around a lot with the car is the gas so cheap? I said tell him her husband is in America and they're loaded, you don't say this to me dad and you know very well

ar_4949.scr-408.13-418.62-B	how are you talking like this I'm not gonna wait for someone to come and tell me this, you can't do anything like that, I said can't not because I'm afraid you may find out you or your brother or my husband or anybody no dad it's just isn't my nature
ar_4949.scr-419.74-428.22-B	I've never done it when I was young and I could never do it now when I'm married and my husband is making me very happy don't you dare say this to me again and you know what I mean, all that while he's dad is sitting there

ar_4949.scr-489.69-500.80-B	I m going against my will, when he sit to talk to me like that, I started to hit my face, and was so angry, I told them, this is wrong, you are driving me out of my faith, I seek forgiveness from God, you do not have mercy, and you do not allow God's mercy, what do you want from me?
ar_4949.scr-500.85-514.21-B	I do not interfere in anything good or bad, someday if I was paralyzed, or something bad happened to me, you won't help me, nor anybody is going to help my children, leave me alone, I have been alone for a year and a half, nobody knocked my door, and nobody asked how is she doing, the occasion of the prophet's birth was the most recent, your father did not come, here I am telling it in his face
ar_4949.scr-514.37-516.92-B	he didn't come up to wish the children a happy year or anyone

ar_4949.scr-557.10-567.02-B	okay so he went out you see talking isn't gonna do it, saying come on Hooda come on, he doesn't want Hooda to stay with me
ar_4949.scr-567.72-578.55-B	So Joda said, let me tell you something, I'm still not done talking to her. He said leave it alone you won't be able to talk to her, he said leave don't drive me crazy, he yelled at his dad so his dad went downstairs

ar_4949.scr-646.87-651.83-B	I, I have nothing to do with this, if he remembers god, if god exists, he will find the answer
ar_4949.scr-651.96-658.91-B	go downstairs and ask him Hooda, you seem to have forgotten that god does exist Abdo may still remember
ar_4949.scr-659.61-661.79-B	Since you say it didn't happen, Abdullah
