ar_5808.scr-537.92-541.19-A	yeah today... its been snowing since yesterday
ar_5808.scr-541.31-541.90-B	really? is that possible ?
ar_5808.scr-541.90-542.35-A	m
ar_5808.scr-542.32-542.74-B	m
ar_5808.scr-543.17-545.75-A	it snowed before and melted the next day
ar_5808.scr-545.43-546.36-B	yeah yeah
ar_5808.scr-546.14-548.80-A	melted that day because it was not so cold somehow
ar_5808.scr-548.71-549.30-B	m
ar_5808.scr-549.53-554.25-A	but yesterday a very big amount of snow has fallen, the important thing is yesterday was a very strange day
ar_5808.scr-554.44-554.78-B	umm
ar_5808.scr-554.43-559.46-A	it rained in the morning in the tens
ar_5808.scr-559.29-560.37-B	m
ar_5808.scr-560.21-564.07-A	I mean it was not very cold, it was normal cold I mean
ar_5808.scr-564.05-564.60-B	yeah
ar_5808.scr-564.71-567.13-A	but it was, and it was raining heavily
ar_5808.scr-567.42-568.02-B	mmm
ar_5808.scr-567.68-571.73-A	then for example at night after seven or something like that
ar_5808.scr-570.47-572.25-B	[distortion] 
ar_5808.scr-572.03-574.54-A	suddenly the temperature dropped under the zero
ar_5808.scr-575.20-581.51-A	then the rain was steady for a long time then it turns to a snow
ar_5808.scr-582.60-583.64-B	mm
ar_5808.scr-583.02-589.20-A	but the snow was accumulating a lot then today the snow was everywhere
ar_5808.scr-589.07-590.66-B	but it is early for snow
ar_5808.scr-591.08-593.00-A	yes they say that it is
ar_5808.scr-592.20-595.02-B	i mean it is possible a month and half early i mean
ar_5808.scr-595.02-597.10-A	no not a month and half for sure
ar_5808.scr-596.00-598.98-B	i mean mid December when it starts to fall
ar_5808.scr-599.14-599.82-A	where
ar_5808.scr-600.05-601.48-B	normally mid-December i mean
ar_5808.scr-602.00-605.73-A	yes i mean i don't know may be we have more snow that overt here
ar_5808.scr-605.73-606.70-B	possible
ar_5808.scr-606.52-608.60-A	but but i mean
ar_5808.scr-608.70-610.11-B	it is colder there than we have here
ar_5808.scr-609.94-612.17-A	also here it is considered also
ar_5808.scr-612.30-612.78-B	[background] 
ar_5808.scr-612.64-615.65-A	a little early i mean it falls in a quantity
ar_5808.scr-612.78-615.65-B	hmm
ar_5808.scr-617.36-617.86-B	umm
ar_5808.scr-618.62-620.96-A	it didn't fall yet there with you or what
ar_5808.scr-620.62-624.93-B	no it snowed a little but I mean a little and it melted directly too
ar_5808.scr-625.14-625.64-A	hmm
ar_5808.scr-625.24-628.19-B	then the temperature dropped under the zero i mean
ar_5808.scr-628.35-628.89-A	hmm
ar_5808.scr-628.77-630.82-B	under i mean under  thirty two
ar_5808.scr-630.96-631.47-A	hmm
ar_5808.scr-631.55-640.56-B	but today it warmed back a bit in the day, I mean something like seven or eight degree above zero
ar_5808.scr-642.09-649.79-B	but what it just means, after that it will become cold, they say it will fall again, about one or something above zero
ar_5808.scr-649.73-651.92-A	hmm
ar_5808.scr-651.69-653.62-B	which means the one becomes what
ar_5808.scr-654.07-664.47-B	and of course I think the most tiring thing in Winter is the short day time, the day light becomes very short I mean
ar_5808.scr-664.65-665.17-A	umm
ar_5808.scr-665.70-677.46-B	I mean this is what makes the person feels like that, I mean physiologically because of the short light time
ar_5808.scr-677.67-678.11-A	umm
ar_5808.scr-678.27-678.81-B	(( )) 
ar_5808.scr-679.46-682.15-A	then also when the person becomes ..
ar_5838.scr-884.89-887.29-B	in happiness, the environment I mean
ar_5838.scr-887.94-892.82-B	I go get this heat and put it in a jug and then go give it to the gas station to do a re fighting for it
ar_5838.scr-893.23-893.64-A	umm
ar_5838.scr-894.01-894.87-B	paying attention?
ar_5838.scr-895.25-897.28-A	but when you are about to change the oil, yeah
ar_5838.scr-897.43-897.93-B	umm
ar_5838.scr-898.19-899.64-A	you remove the filter, right?
ar_5838.scr-900.15-901.02-B	it is a must
ar_5838.scr-901.27-901.98-A	it is a must
ar_5838.scr-901.29-902.45-B	i have to change the filter
ar_5838.scr-902.55-906.66-A	after that you put the new filter and after that you put the three
ar_5838.scr-906.79-907.22-B	yeah
ar_5838.scr-907.29-907.71-A	but
ar_5838.scr-907.87-908.29-B	yeah
ar_5838.scr-908.58-909.05-A	no
ar_5838.scr-909.30-909.83-B	then what?
ar_5838.scr-909.56-911.55-A	this is why I m telling you it doesn't take three but three and a half
ar_5838.scr-911.79-912.30-B	why
ar_5838.scr-912.42-914.22-A	then when you put the new filter
ar_5838.scr-914.38-914.79-B	hmm
ar_5838.scr-914.42-915.74-A	the filter stays empty
ar_5838.scr-915.83-916.30-B	hmm
ar_5838.scr-917.37-922.56-A	what I mean to say is to make sure that all of the oil will go out after you remove the filter, start the engine
ar_5838.scr-923.40-927.71-A	you will find that the pump took this little oil and throw them out, that is something
ar_5838.scr-927.57-932.64-B	no this is risky, you empty then start the engine, there are some people who do what
ar_5838.scr-930.98-935.24-A	no it is just for seconds, it's for seconds
ar_5838.scr-935.57-939.68-B	yeah but what some people do to avoid the risk, is that you
ar_5838.scr-940.00-942.43-B	to start without having oil even if for seconds
ar_5838.scr-943.12-947.19-B	after all the oil was out they put
ar_5838.scr-947.12-947.40-A	umm
ar_5838.scr-947.95-956.03-B	he gets a new one and then pour it and opens the plug and empty it too
ar_5838.scr-956.19-957.56-A	no no no
ar_5838.scr-957.20-960.16-B	so it absorb all the dirt and the old lubricating oil and be drained
ar_5838.scr-959.03-965.36-A	if you want to do that there is a chemical called engine flush engine
ar_5838.scr-965.70-966.24-B	hmm..
ar_5838.scr-966.28-967.17-A	it's name is dank
ar_5838.scr-967.44-967.93-B	hmm..
ar_5838.scr-967.84-970.03-A	it will be quarter gallon like the gasoline
ar_5838.scr-969.27-970.71-B	M
ar_5838.scr-970.65-973.37-A	Not gas but like gas it is something chemical it is liquid
ar_5838.scr-972.14-974.95-B	Mmm
ar_5838.scr-974.51-979.94-A	Before you change the oil put it all in the motor and make it run for about 15 minute
ar_5838.scr-979.99-980.52-B	M
ar_5838.scr-980.19-982.27-A	This chemical well clean for you all the line
ar_5838.scr-982.46-983.35-B	Mm
ar_5838.scr-982.99-987.28-A	And it clean for you the dirts that are in the engine and after that do the oil you will find it all come down drain
ar_5838.scr-988.74-989.22-B	Yes
ar_5838.scr-988.87-989.32-A	(( )) 
ar_5838.scr-989.38-989.94-B	M
ar_5838.scr-989.82-996.27-A	So anyway so when you disassemble the filter and put a new filter and put oil you must turn on the motor (su) for quarter of a minute
ar_5838.scr-996.34-997.02-B	M
ar_5838.scr-996.81-1001.38-A	Because the oil will beat each other and it will go beating the liens all of it
ar_5838.scr-1001.42-1002.10-B	M
ar_5838.scr-1001.83-1006.11-A	And it will enter the filter and after that we will measure the oil again you will find it half decreased half of it
ar_5838.scr-1006.61-1008.41-B	Mmm
ar_5838.scr-1008.62-1011.06-A	That's why I tell you cut its half I mean this is the minimum I mean
ar_5838.scr-1011.83-1012.41-B	Hm
ar_5838.scr-1012.66-1014.38-A	Do you know that I installed a motor by myself
ar_5838.scr-1014.54-1016.52-B	you installed a motor
ar_5838.scr-1016.48-1017.06-A	yes
ar_5838.scr-1017.02-1017.61-B	Yah
ar_5838.scr-1018.12-1020.30-A	I started to do some mechanics works
ar_5838.scr-1020.87-1021.35-B	M
ar_5838.scr-1021.64-1022.32-A	I do brake
ar_5838.scr-1022.95-1023.39-B	M
ar_5838.scr-1023.25-1025.97-A	What, I repair motors I installed a motor here
ar_5838.scr-1026.73-1030.89-B	No I this motor yet I never done it I mean but I the brake brake are easy
ar_5838.scr-1031.43-1033.12-B	Belts are easy
ar_5838.scr-1033.28-1033.72-A	Mm
ar_5838.scr-1033.79-1036.01-B	Radiator easy all these I done them before

ar_5838.scr-1043.25-1044.70-B	Or yes that is very easy
ar_5838.scr-1044.80-1045.58-A	If you need welding
ar_5838.scr-1046.10-1047.63-B	There isn't weldings here oh boss no
ar_5838.scr-1047.22-1048.46-A	Yes if there isn't weldings then never mind

ar_5838.scr-1051.67-1053.33-B	He will, and (يقرط) and we are done like this
ar_5838.scr-1054.05-1059.12-B	here any mechanic must install the muffler, there is no welding or such
ar_5838.scr-1059.59-1061.44-A	no there are some, some mufflers
ar_5838.scr-1061.18-1061.62-B	no
ar_5838.scr-1061.44-1062.33-A	no welding muffler
ar_5838.scr-1062.79-1065.15-B	maybe this must be something stylish, old but
ar_5838.scr-1064.96-1065.24-A	umm
ar_5838.scr-1065.20-1067.83-B	all the modern now, there is nothing called
ar_5838.scr-1067.80-1069.25-A	there is welding that is no no

ar_5838.scr-1085.28-1089.86-B	so I went and saw it and he said no here it's price
ar_5838.scr-1088.80-1093.20-A	yes all the mufflers come
ar_5838.scr-1093.37-1093.90-B	one piece
ar_5838.scr-1093.60-1095.10-A	four parts for example
ar_5838.scr-1095.43-1095.84-B	yes
ar_5838.scr-1096.26-1098.70-A	one part of these four parts is welded, another part
ar_5838.scr-1099.12-1099.84-B	not welded
ar_5838.scr-1099.61-1100.63-A	but one part comes
ar_5838.scr-1101.40-1102.40-B	there is the part
ar_5838.scr-1101.79-1105.19-A	so when it becomes ruined, this part is cut, and you install that part, install that part manually
ar_5838.scr-1105.81-1106.17-B	Yes
ar_5838.scr-1105.68-1106.89-A	this if you want to do this

ar_5838.scr-1111.53-1117.92-B	yes if you want to bring, because what happens at the dealer's or at the respectful companies like speedy
ar_5838.scr-1116.61-1118.26-A	you will find that it is all clips, all of it is clips
ar_5838.scr-1118.40-1121.88-B	this enters in that, that enters in this, and you cut this, insert it in that, and cut ...
ar_5838.scr-1119.82-1120.29-A	yeah
ar_5838.scr-1121.94-1124.77-B	and we finish like that, this is the proper thing, which is the ..

ar_7001.scr-497.68-498.17-A	Fine.
ar_7001.scr-498.39-503.42-A	God willing I'm optimistic, but he was looking at the date of 5/6 so I told him that 5/6....
ar_7001.scr-503.93-505.88-A	that date has ended and he is there now
