ar_4264.scr-374.69-377.38-B	So how Ji took the doctorate just after it.
ar_4264.scr-377.27-383.94-A	As she took something for the English minorities as she is minority not American
ar_4264.scr-384.22-384.67-B	yes
ar_4264.scr-384.56-388.62-A	so I do not know for what she took money from the government

ar_4530.scr-274.24-275.74-B	mhm
ar_4530.scr-274.37-279.00-A	that the other one for example, or I don't know, you explain to him that the other one agreed or that he doesn't have a problem

ar_4530.scr-289.94-291.13-A	Yes exactly
ar_4530.scr-290.87-295.78-B	No, but I want her to come I mean, by the way, you understand

ar_4530.scr-306.15-306.50-A	Yeah
