ar_5808.scr-572.03-574.54-A	all of sudden temperature fell below zero

ar_5808.scr-609.94-612.17-A	yeah its cold here too
ar_5808.scr-612.30-612.78-B	[background] 
ar_5808.scr-612.64-615.65-A	its a bit early for it to come down this much
ar_5808.scr-612.78-615.65-B	hmm..
ar_5808.scr-617.36-617.86-B	m
ar_5808.scr-618.62-620.96-A	still nothing came down at your end?
ar_5808.scr-620.62-624.93-B	there was a small amount of snow but it melted immediately
ar_5808.scr-625.14-625.64-A	hmm
ar_5808.scr-625.24-628.19-B	and then temperatures dropped below zero
ar_5808.scr-628.35-628.89-A	hmm
ar_5808.scr-628.77-630.82-B	below meaning 2 or 3 I mean
ar_5808.scr-630.96-631.47-A	hmm
ar_5808.scr-631.55-640.56-B	but today it wormed up a little like 7 or 8 above zero
ar_5808.scr-642.09-649.79-B	but they say that it will get back to 1 or 2 above zero
ar_5808.scr-649.73-651.92-A	hmm
ar_5808.scr-651.69-653.62-B	it was so hard
ar_5808.scr-654.07-664.47-B	it seems that the hardest thing in the winter is how short the day is . the day is very short
ar_5808.scr-664.65-665.17-A	m
ar_5808.scr-665.70-677.46-B	I mean that's what makes one feel down from how short the day is
ar_5808.scr-677.67-678.11-A	m
ar_5808.scr-678.27-678.81-B	(( )) 
ar_5808.scr-679.46-682.15-A	and then when someone is...
ar_5838.scr-884.89-887.29-B	it was up normal enviroment
ar_5838.scr-887.94-892.82-B	I  take the heat and put it in the jug and give it to the gas station they refine it
ar_5838.scr-893.23-893.64-A	m
ar_5838.scr-894.01-894.87-B	you pay attention
ar_5838.scr-895.25-897.28-A	but when you change the oil yeah
ar_5838.scr-897.43-897.93-B	m
ar_5838.scr-898.19-899.64-A	you have to take the filter off right?
ar_5838.scr-900.15-901.02-B	yes of course
ar_5838.scr-901.27-901.98-A	you have to
ar_5838.scr-901.29-902.45-B	I should change the filter
ar_5838.scr-902.55-906.66-A	after that you put the new filtr and you put the three
ar_5838.scr-906.79-907.22-B	yeah
ar_5838.scr-907.29-907.71-A	but
ar_5838.scr-907.87-908.29-B	yeah
ar_5838.scr-908.58-909.05-A	no
ar_5838.scr-909.30-909.83-B	then what?
ar_5838.scr-909.56-911.55-A	that's why I told you not to accept three but take three and half
ar_5838.scr-911.79-912.30-B	why?
ar_5838.scr-912.42-914.22-A	what when you put the new filter?
ar_5838.scr-914.38-914.79-B	m
ar_5838.scr-914.42-915.74-A	the filter would be empty
ar_5838.scr-915.83-916.30-B	m
ar_5838.scr-917.37-922.56-A	so you can guarantee the oil out after you take the filter out turn the motor on
ar_5838.scr-923.40-927.71-A	you will find that the pump took the leftover oil and put them in the air, that's one thing
ar_5838.scr-927.57-932.64-B	it is too risky to empty the tank and ignite the engine at the same time
ar_5838.scr-930.98-935.24-A	no its ...seconds seconds seconds
ar_5838.scr-935.57-939.68-B	yeah but you know what some people do to not take the risk
ar_5838.scr-940.00-942.43-B	ignite the engine without lubrication even for few seconds
ar_5838.scr-943.12-947.19-B	then they start to refill after emptying all the lubricating oil
ar_5838.scr-947.12-947.40-A	hmm..
ar_5838.scr-947.95-956.03-B	then put cleaning liquid and open the drain till emptying it
ar_5838.scr-956.19-957.56-A	no no no
ar_5838.scr-957.20-960.16-B	it takes dirt with it and the old with new
ar_5838.scr-959.03-965.36-A	No if you want like this there is some thing called engine flush engine dank flush engine
ar_5838.scr-965.70-966.24-B	M
ar_5838.scr-966.28-967.17-A	its name dank
ar_5838.scr-967.44-967.93-B	m
ar_5838.scr-967.84-970.03-A	you will find quarter a gallon like the gas
ar_5838.scr-969.27-970.71-B	hmm..
ar_5838.scr-970.65-973.37-A	not a gasoline but a chemical like the gasoline
ar_5838.scr-972.14-974.95-B	hmm..
ar_5838.scr-974.51-979.94-A	before emptying the lubricating oil from the engine put it and let the engine run for fifteen minutes
ar_5838.scr-979.99-980.52-B	hmm..
ar_5838.scr-980.19-982.27-A	this chemical will clean the engine lines
ar_5838.scr-982.46-983.35-B	hmm..
ar_5838.scr-982.99-987.28-A	and will clean all the dirt from the engine and after that start to drain the lubricating oil
ar_5838.scr-988.74-989.22-B	yeah
ar_5838.scr-988.87-989.32-A	(( )) 
ar_5838.scr-989.38-989.94-B	hmm..
ar_5838.scr-989.82-996.27-A	after changing the filter and the oil you should run the engine for quarter minute
ar_5838.scr-996.34-997.02-B	hmm..
ar_5838.scr-996.81-1001.38-A	to let the oil moves in all the engine lines
ar_5838.scr-1001.42-1002.10-B	hmm..
ar_5838.scr-1001.83-1006.11-A	and enters the filter and after that measure the oil level you will find it need to be increased
ar_5838.scr-1006.61-1008.41-B	hmm..
ar_5838.scr-1008.62-1011.06-A	so that's why I said to you to fill it to it's half
