ar_7012.scr-177.35-182.51-B	there is <English out line> but there isn't <English direction> still not setteled so I must do something I mean

ar_7012.scr-193.19-198.73-B	you learn and do <English proposal> and we get the supervisor to see the <English proposal> the Egyptian and if he agreed you go continue in Egypt
ar_7012.scr-198.77-199.40-A	what is this
ar_7012.scr-198.83-203.54-B	I told him no, you will be confusing me sir if I did that
ar_7012.scr-203.76-204.19-A	Mmm
ar_7012.scr-203.91-209.00-B	If I came to Egypt, this means that by all means that I will not finish the message minimum before five years
ar_7012.scr-208.96-209.37-A	M
ar_7012.scr-209.39-211.10-B	From the date I come to Egypt
ar_7012.scr-211.16-211.67-A	Mmm
ar_7012.scr-211.61-223.63-B	I told him sir I can not (acmi) he told me how (umm) do you see that the things that you take in Egypt and (mi) can qualify you to do Ph.D. he told me OK so what I am not telling you it is hundred out of hundred but certainly we too take things that are not, we don't take
ar_7012.scr-223.65-227.48-B	I Saied right this is the library but I want to write it at home
ar_7012.scr-227.63-228.09-A	m
ar_7012.scr-227.99-237.55-B	but doctor Nehad I can't take courses, they wants me to finish my research only and I told him to take care that I'm following the Egyptian rules not a free student
ar_7012.scr-237.82-238.26-A	hmm..
ar_7012.scr-238.39-244.44-B	there is a student his name is Nader has a full free scholarship he compared me with him
ar_7012.scr-244.72-252.39-B	This Nader is staying five years two years of studies and three to do the letter i am supposed to stay two years to study and take the letter
ar_7012.scr-252.43-252.98-A	m
ar_7012.scr-252.90-256.14-B	I can't do like that
ar_7012.scr-257.07-263.04-B	So i told him i am not supposed to stay and study the details of Amercia
ar_7012.scr-263.33-269.67-B	The one not mine and not for student
ar_7012.scr-270.01-279.90-B	OK I should know that in general the issue is going I mean I am not wanted to get into details i HAVE no time to talk
ar_7012.scr-278.84-281.51-A	No, the best thing for you is to assist to the methods classes.
ar_7012.scr-282.02-284.83-B	Okey it doesn't matter if i come
ar_7012.scr-283.77-284.32-A	Yeah yeah.
ar_7012.scr-284.99-290.92-B	Right now we're talking about legal, they're asking very weird stuff and there are possibly enters, it's probably..
ar_7012.scr-291.12-297.73-B	So I found out that I'm wasting my time Ahmed, it's like I'm having an exam, so I'm not kidding, what am I going to do with the grades?
ar_7012.scr-298.03-303.39-B	So I told him Doctor Nihad, I'm not against taking classes, I will take them but as an audit, so he asked me what's the difference.
ar_7012.scr-303.60-311.54-B	I told him the difference for me in as an audit that the subjects that I find myself in it, are not my area the area of my specialization, because the problem is the faculty here came out to be
ar_7012.scr-311.54-315.19-B	More oh Ahmad OK I mean regional
ar_7012.scr-314.44-315.64-A	You are certainly interdisciplinary
ar_7012.scr-316.09-325.30-B	exactly therefore I need to direct myself on what I am reading, so I told him I am not requested to stay and drown in all topics which I am not interested in
ar_7012.scr-325.71-331.21-B	it's possible that anybody there whom he is taking care, his subject i regional, and he will implement it on America
ar_7012.scr-331.37-332.25-A	swear
ar_7012.scr-331.51-333.12-B	the subject bilinis yes it is
ar_7012.scr-332.57-333.94-A	he will go to America
ar_7012.scr-333.96-340.48-B	I I don't know he says that I should take permission from Taher and there is doctor Taher that the idea was in front of him
ar_7012.scr-340.54-341.01-A	yes
ar_7012.scr-340.85-343.86-B	he said no of course you are going there to study thousands of cases there
ar_7012.scr-344.13-344.49-A	yes
ar_7012.scr-344.49-347.61-B	I said you are supposed to take he said I won't send it and didn't reply
ar_7012.scr-347.94-349.45-B	so he won't care
ar_7012.scr-349.51-349.98-A	m
ar_7012.scr-350.24-359.78-B	what then, so I told him for me my case is not regional and my subject isn't Cairo, I do not mind taking but when the person is audit
ar_7012.scr-360.31-365.34-B	He can focus or write or stay with the details which he wants Oh Ahmed, right or I'm wrong
ar_7012.scr-364.55-365.61-A	Yeah right right
ar_7012.scr-366.06-375.80-B	Important, we finished talking he told me,I felt that he got disappointed about me, very honest he draw a picture or Doctor Brad gave him a picture and I gave him a different picture,I told him Doctor Nihad I'm not acting like pampered person
ar_7012.scr-376.24-381.56-B	make sure yourself, someone who left her house, husband, son, and came to here, it won't be for fondness
ar_7012.scr-381.75-387.09-B	I don't know anybody here, I do not go out there is nothing for me to do except to read, so I m not uncomfortable because I read, in the contrary
ar_7012.scr-387.37-397.25-B	But the idea that I at least feel oh Ahmad that I am doing something for the letter for the goal that I came for, I told him I am Muna oh Doctor Nihad I came for the letter with utmost honesty
ar_7012.scr-397.70-403.41-B	as you say knowledge for knowledge, I respect it but I have time so it would be knowledge for knowledge
ar_7012.scr-403.45-410.99-B	Now I have no time so this is not the suitable time that I say Knowledge for knowledge when I finish the things that are waiting me then I will look at knowledge for knowledge
ar_7012.scr-411.74-417.75-B	Only and I walked away of course I don't know whether he got upset or he didn't get upset the important thing I mean that today Metwalli talked with him
ar_7012.scr-417.92-422.67-B	he says no and he talks I mean he was not mad he had a plan
ar_7015.scr-502.14-506.09-A	if he is riding a car he will go on roads comapred to these roads in Egypt
ar_7015.scr-506.10-508.57-B	yes I undwerstand this he will live well I mean
ar_7015.scr-506.52-510.30-A	yes if he had issue for example
ar_7015.scr-510.63-513.63-A	lost his money or he is not working
ar_7015.scr-513.88-518.34-A	then there is unemployment insurance, things like that, I mean there are benefits
ar_7015.scr-516.33-520.89-B	what you say is true of course, the living level there is very high
ar_7015.scr-520.58-522.13-A	yes so
ar_7015.scr-521.60-522.39-B	but
ar_7015.scr-522.19-523.77-A	whta I mean, I think that he won't lose
ar_7015.scr-523.66-526.28-B	but there are many Egyptians living in a better standard than this in Egypt
ar_7015.scr-526.80-527.75-A	alright no problem
ar_7015.scr-527.85-529.75-B	that's why them coming to Canada is meaningless
ar_7015.scr-530.11-533.55-B	them coming to Canada is meaningless and one of those he he intend to go back again
ar_7015.scr-534.00-536.12-B	he intends to go back, we sit and talked to him a little he
ar_7015.scr-535.60-538.05-A	no I want to tell you about something, there is a point I want to tell you about
ar_7015.scr-537.01-538.55-B	mm go ahead
ar_7015.scr-538.54-544.68-A	most people when they come and get a shock and I don't know what they tell you I will go back and the story and that will not be good and so
ar_7015.scr-543.96-544.76-B	But after that he sits
ar_7015.scr-545.03-545.91-A	But little by little
ar_7015.scr-545.97-547.26-B	he will like to stay
ar_7015.scr-546.26-551.22-A	He get used to (il) the system he get used to the situation and forget this talk and become integrated and live and the matter is ended
ar_7015.scr-551.30-552.00-B	he will like to stay
ar_7015.scr-552.06-555.38-A	this is how it should be, you won't bring someone
ar_7015.scr-555.70-560.17-A	from somewhere and put him somewhere else, he is not like a mango tree
ar_7015.scr-560.26-560.81-B	Perfect
ar_7015.scr-560.27-561.37-A	You will look and find it that's it, you come
ar_7015.scr-561.77-567.10-A	even if a tree in Allah's name it must take time until it gets used to the new envirnoment where it is being put
ar_7015.scr-567.20-567.67-B	Good
ar_7015.scr-567.58-567.87-A	and bi

ar_7015.scr-573.82-581.06-A	And then and then you start to (ti) (ti) walk in the new (blCaB) it is a must that any person coming from a new place
ar_7015.scr-580.11-581.09-B	A natural reaction
ar_7015.scr-581.36-584.28-A	There must happen some rejection to him at the beginning like this and a little
ar_7015.scr-584.57-586.05-A	Drum beating and a little what
ar_7015.scr-585.02-586.68-B	Little panic they are

ar_7047.scr-1528.10-1529.11-A	they
ar_7047.scr-1528.54-1531.71-B	which direction the whole brick building had fallen
ar_7047.scr-1531.81-1534.43-A	You are kidding me. Is that reasonable?
ar_7047.scr-1532.20-1535.69-B	Yes nine stories. I was walking in John street, coming back...
ar_7047.scr-1535.58-1536.33-A	they
ar_7047.scr-1535.93-1540.44-B	In downtown here there were repair work in the street. I thought they were fixing the pavement. There was a big thing happening.
ar_7047.scr-1540.77-1545.47-B	so i went back to talk to Nayel he told me i don't know so i asked him have you read the spectator
ar_7047.scr-1545.55-1546.11-A	they
ar_7047.scr-1545.79-1549.63-B	no i don't know a thing he said it is all red brick
ar_7047.scr-1549.63-1550.05-A	hmm
ar_7047.scr-1550.11-1553.45-B	I mean the building didn't collapse, nine floors hit the ground
ar_7047.scr-1553.37-1554.34-A	what is the reason then
ar_7047.scr-1553.77-1558.08-B	and they say dramatically, means not dramatically but incredibly no one was injured
ar_7047.scr-1558.39-1558.68-A	hmm
ar_7047.scr-1558.92-1566.86-B	they say it was a surprise, so they say the architect is the reason, once he told me that I told him of course some backward architect wanted to adjust the front's caculations
ar_7047.scr-1567.15-1575.44-B	on the basis that he won't do anything to remove these things, so one brick fall down and sent all the rest down to the street
ar_7047.scr-1576.06-1579.13-A	what have the bricks in some floor to do with the bricks in the floors below it
ar_7047.scr-1580.18-1582.52-B	because they are all set in one direction
ar_7047.scr-1583.36-1590.61-B	they are almost glued to wall but they are installed on each other brick after brick the whole nine floors
ar_7047.scr-1592.16-1594.01-A	Isn't there a slab between each floor
ar_7047.scr-1594.39-1602.57-B	Yes but (ilE) but the brick and the direction of the bricks from outside not held on slabs you see it all one piece there isn't between them even a slip
ar_7047.scr-1604.67-1606.30-A	hmm that's terrible
ar_7047.scr-1606.62-1608.44-B	so it is an unusual surprise
ar_7047.scr-1608.81-1609.17-A	hmm
ar_7047.scr-1609.14-1613.89-B	this is one story the other one is stranger than fiction, some people in South America
ar_7047.scr-1613.98-1614.30-A	hmm
ar_7047.scr-1614.39-1616.86-B	they went to hunt some frogs, are you paying attention
ar_7047.scr-1616.91-1618.62-A	frogs hmm
ar_7047.scr-1617.55-1626.59-B	frogs and they went in a truck, then in the way one said what is going on guys, he found that the front lights went off, so he was looking for fuses, every time he puts a fuse it burns
ar_7047.scr-1626.75-1627.03-A	They are
ar_7047.scr-1627.15-1628.95-B	Then he found that in his pocket there is what a bullet
ar_7047.scr-1629.40-1629.69-A	They are
ar_7047.scr-1630.04-1634.84-B	So he tell you he found a bullet by the way the size of a fuse
ar_7047.scr-1634.45-1636.89-A	hmm and then he put it
ar_7047.scr-1635.37-1640.85-B	he put it in the fuse place, and went on after seven minutes, the bullet was heated and hit his gentiles

ar_7047.scr-1648.14-1657.35-B	yes while he was driving the bullet was hit so if course he hit a tree then he got out of the car the important thing is that the man beside him got concussions and nothing happened to him but DA the equipment where lost from him do you understand what I mean
