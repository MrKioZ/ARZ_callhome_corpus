ar_5790.scr-696.12-697.02-B	yes
ar_5790.scr-696.72-698.58-A	most of are the
ar_5790.scr-697.97-699.98-B	why then why
ar_5790.scr-700.84-704.57-A	as the ratio is big so the Arabs are few while the ratio
ar_5790.scr-704.36-705.23-B	yes
ar_5790.scr-704.61-706.33-A	the Mexicans
ar_5790.scr-705.75-707.80-B	mm of course of course
ar_5790.scr-706.92-711.37-A	and Puerto Rico of south America the South America countries all speak Spanish
ar_5790.scr-709.39-711.46-B	mm hard
ar_5790.scr-712.26-712.86-A	Not arabic
ar_5790.scr-712.26-715.08-B	That's why the second language is Spanish since the immigrants are more.
ar_5790.scr-715.23-715.76-A	YEah
ar_5790.scr-715.56-717.01-B	From this country mhm.
ar_5790.scr-717.26-722.46-A	People with business prefer that the person speaks English and Spanish
ar_5790.scr-722.17-724.37-B	Two languages English and Spanish.
ar_5790.scr-724.55-728.35-A	He could interact with workers and with clients, something like that
ar_5790.scr-726.60-729.54-B	mhm correct and the Spanish language is difficult.
ar_5790.scr-730.62-733.79-A	I mean it's difficult for me of course.
ar_5790.scr-733.32-734.16-B	{laugh} 
ar_5790.scr-733.82-736.14-A	Yeah it's difficult.
ar_5790.scr-734.57-736.95-B	It's weird.
ar_5790.scr-736.23-742.79-A	Any new language is for sure difficult, for example English, right now my English level is good, thank God.
ar_5790.scr-738.87-742.56-B	Exactly, of course mhm.
ar_5790.scr-742.81-744.83-A	So that you learn Spanish too.
ar_5790.scr-743.20-743.81-B	mhm.
ar_5790.scr-744.88-748.27-A	and you have Arabic and I don't know what else.

ar_5790.scr-755.27-755.72-B	Not like that.
ar_5790.scr-756.43-763.38-A	But for example, the people whose mother language is Spanish and came here to America or were born in America or are staying
ar_5790.scr-761.38-765.56-B	... comfortably, it's because it's only Spanish and English for them.
ar_5790.scr-765.36-768.97-A	Yeah, so it's pretty simple for you.
ar_5790.scr-766.16-768.71-B	you know why we were not Spanish now
ar_5790.scr-769.16-774.61-A	And it depends also there are other things more than acquaintance and relationship and those things like this I mean the owner of the job
ar_5790.scr-769.91-774.45-B	Why maTlic m
ar_5790.scr-774.73-779.28-A	He doesn't trust anyone I mean who like to recruit the one he knows

ar_5790.scr-795.44-798.82-B	Ah exactly like this
ar_5790.scr-797.84-801.30-A	so he fears that if he hired anyone, it's possible that he can take over his business.
