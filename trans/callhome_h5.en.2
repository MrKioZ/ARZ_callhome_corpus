ar_5829.scr-1196.04-1196.59-B	yes
ar_5829.scr-1196.74-1197.02-A	and you

ar_5829.scr-1201.30-1203.79-A	Good thanks God, he sends you his best regards, he said
ar_6997.scr-473.31-479.94-B	No I mean the idea is that there are many Egyptian women groups here, and also Arabs and so on, so you look and find them I mean
ar_6997.scr-479.98-489.09-B	but they go out with each other in the morning, they meet for example, stay at the house of one of them, then go shopping, or such on, so thanks God the matter is reasonable for them
ar_6997.scr-489.26-493.88-A	Good Heba, in the few daysI came to the house here, I almost didn't go out
ar_6997.scr-493.88-495.81-B	why, don't you have many Egyptian communities there
ar_6997.scr-496.59-498.51-A	I settled down far away
ar_6997.scr-499.40-502.70-A	The Egyptians are living in
ar_6997.scr-503.10-503.62-B	Why ?
ar_6997.scr-504.52-505.39-A	well this is what happened
ar_6997.scr-506.01-507.62-B	ah means it wasn't you who chose
ar_6997.scr-508.03-514.18-A	I chose yes but I chose because that I since the beginning know that the Egyptians abroad are not .. how to say
ar_6997.scr-515.00-517.45-B	No on the contrary I mean what I felt here was
ar_6997.scr-516.66-517.61-A	all of them are good
ar_6997.scr-517.85-524.18-B	
ar_6997.scr-524.54-531.58-B	There were a really good people they make it easier for me
ar_6997.scr-531.92-532.24-A	{cough} 
ar_6997.scr-531.62-540.08-B	Everything, for example it's legal procedures or something like that they help you to know what to do and what not to do
ar_6997.scr-539.17-541.71-A	when the person comes here, he is lost, not knowing anything in anything
ar_6997.scr-541.94-551.48-B	exactly, so the Egyptians were very helpful in this matter and else than that, I mean here the people are very nice, you look and find that for example every month on average there must be outing in the open
ar_6997.scr-551.59-560.69-B	what all the people here must do is to go and have a barbeque for example in some place or they go something like Niagara Falls
ar_6997.scr-561.41-565.01-B	Anything like that, so the people  are good here
ar_6997.scr-565.23-567.54-A	how far are you from Niagara Falls
ar_6997.scr-569.00-570.19-B	nearly within two hundred kilometers

ar_6997.scr-593.97-594.33-B	what is this
ar_6997.scr-594.63-595.05-A	yes really

ar_6997.scr-597.15-600.21-A	Yes, there is about five hundred between me and New York
ar_6997.scr-602.24-604.51-B	What a news
ar_6997.scr-604.20-609.76-A	From me to Falls it supposed to be about four hours
ar_6997.scr-611.66-618.94-B	four hours not much we can meet there once for example or something
ar_6997.scr-619.19-619.89-A	may God make it easy
ar_6997.scr-619.93-620.30-B	(( )) 
ar_6997.scr-619.99-624.39-A	of course after our wives give birth
ar_6997.scr-622.30-628.47-B	yes, she will on next Summer God willing, I mean this is not the main problem, also the problem is that starting on next month, it will snow in Niagara
ar_6997.scr-628.80-629.17-A	yes
ar_6997.scr-629.26-631.70-B	means it will freeze starting next month, so it would be pointless
ar_6997.scr-632.37-638.83-A	God willing I intend to on next Summer, God willing I should go, or go to Niagara or to California
ar_6997.scr-640.00-642.90-B	no California is hard
ar_6997.scr-642.80-644.11-A	No, for California not driving
ar_6997.scr-644.56-653.03-B	No, not about driving, the life is very expensive there, when you went to there you will forced to stay in five stars hotels or four stars and things
ar_6997.scr-653.86-655.77-B	Their price are too much, especially that the all
ar_6997.scr-655.39-658.71-A	Why man, there are motels on the high ways that are working
ar_6997.scr-658.92-659.23-B	Yes
ar_6997.scr-659.30-660.24-A	You'll not say NO, means
ar_6997.scr-660.57-664.19-B	Means not very easy, the motels means that you stay
ar_6997.scr-662.98-665.44-A	I will go, I'll not go alone, I'll go with my little sir
ar_6997.scr-666.02-666.38-B	yes
ar_6997.scr-666.57-669.65-A	that is the long tail here
ar_6997.scr-668.25-670.67-B	{laugh}

ar_6997.scr-706.71-708.00-B	him alone or him and Nadir
ar_6997.scr-708.51-710.68-A	Not him alone
ar_6997.scr-711.67-719.68-B	Because all the past year he was telling us that Nader will comes with him to America and they went to Oakland
ar_6997.scr-720.01-722.98-A	No, it's probably the project is finished he went to the place
ar_6997.scr-723.97-724.56-B	m
ar_6997.scr-725.13-731.18-A	And probably Oakland, big probability that Nader and Sherif went, so the big Hassan will come

ar_7009.scr-812.63-814.94-B	the people here are not helping me a little
ar_7009.scr-815.38-817.55-B	so I thought to tell them fine guys, I will go

ar_7012.scr-135.73-137.40-A	No around the campus
ar_7012.scr-137.66-140.72-B	When we were around maybe because we were in down town
ar_7012.scr-141.60-146.45-B	You cross the street, mean the idea is there is a street if you cross it,they do nothing for  you
ar_7012.scr-145.85-148.66-A	I stayed on the beach
ar_7012.scr-146.77-158.81-B	I stayed on the beach thank god there is nothing but this day i was trying to be patient and say there is a goal
ar_7012.scr-158.30-158.67-A	m
ar_7012.scr-159.09-163.88-B	I went to stay i didn't tell you i wanted to call you i went to the doctor yesterday
ar_7012.scr-163.90-164.45-A	m
ar_7012.scr-164.43-168.24-B	I told him there is no time i looked to the letter that Ahmed sent
ar_7012.scr-168.41-168.90-A	m
ar_7012.scr-168.53-171.10-B	All the day i study two subjects
ar_7012.scr-171.10-171.99-A	Ha
ar_7012.scr-171.93-176.52-B	In the letter i told him like this i don't know what i am supposed to do exactly
ar_7012.scr-176.72-177.37-A	mm
ar_7012.scr-177.35-182.51-B	There is out line but there is not a direction so i should do something
ar_7012.scr-182.45-182.98-A	mhm.
ar_7012.scr-183.12-193.04-B	So I can't like this, he told me I had schedule and that I know that the channel system is not required in the two years, better that I study..
ar_7012.scr-193.19-198.73-B	You learn to make a proposal, then we bring the supervisor to check the Egyptian proposal and if he agreed, you can proceed/continue in Egypt
ar_7012.scr-198.77-199.40-A	what is that
ar_7012.scr-198.83-203.54-B	I told him no, I told him if I did this I will be lost your honor, I can't do this.
ar_7012.scr-203.76-204.19-A	m
ar_7012.scr-203.91-209.00-B	If i go to egypt i am supposed to give the letter five years before
ar_7012.scr-208.96-209.37-A	m
ar_7012.scr-209.39-211.10-B	Since I came to Egypt.
ar_7012.scr-211.16-211.67-A	mhm.
ar_7012.scr-211.61-223.63-B	I told him I can't your honor, he told me why, you know that what you get in Egypt can make eligible for a Doctorate.I said okay, I mean I'm not saying one hundred percent but also we definitely get things that  are not supposed to be taken.
ar_7012.scr-223.65-227.48-B	So the ideas is and that here there is a library I won't sit like this, when I am at home I will sit to write it
ar_7012.scr-227.63-228.09-A	m
ar_7012.scr-227.99-237.55-B	But doctor Nihed i can't take courses i mean i must have a letter i told him i am not
ar_7012.scr-237.82-238.26-A	m
ar_7012.scr-238.39-244.44-B	There is a boy who's name is Nader he told me that i am supposed to take i don't what Nader takes so i told him no
ar_7012.scr-244.72-252.39-B	but I told him that Nader was studding for two years and three years for finishing the research but in my case I have only two years for both of them
ar_7012.scr-252.43-252.98-A	hmm..
ar_7012.scr-252.90-256.14-B	so it is too difficult for me to do that
ar_7012.scr-257.07-263.04-B	so I told him that it isn't required for me to study the English policies of America
ar_7012.scr-263.33-269.67-B	that she don't have no no no in area of mine and not for student and not in area of mine in my study
ar_7012.scr-270.01-279.90-B	Okey i must know in general that the subjects are doing fine but it is not supposed for me to enter inside this speech
ar_7012.scr-278.84-281.51-A	No the best thing to do is to prepare the methods
ar_7012.scr-282.02-284.83-B	Okay, as an audit I'm not against attending.
ar_7012.scr-283.77-284.32-A	Ah ah
ar_7012.scr-284.99-290.92-B	Now at this moment we talk about bizarre things
ar_7012.scr-291.12-297.73-B	Ahmed if i waste my time to enter the exam i will going to laugh of my self because what am i going to do
ar_7012.scr-298.03-303.39-B	So i told him doctor Nihed i am not against someone who took courses i will take courses so he told me where is the difference
ar_7012.scr-303.60-311.54-B	I told him the difference for me is that the subjects that i will follow aren't mine
ar_7012.scr-311.54-315.19-B	I mean ok Ahmed
ar_7012.scr-314.44-315.64-A	This is surly you
ar_7012.scr-316.09-325.30-B	Exactly yes i need to read so i told him i am not supposed to swim in all these subjects
ar_7012.scr-325.71-331.21-B	Maybe every person have his subject that he will work on about Amercia
ar_7012.scr-331.37-332.25-A	I swear god
ar_7012.scr-331.51-333.12-B	The subject is
ar_7012.scr-332.57-333.94-A	Metwaly well apply for America
ar_7012.scr-333.96-340.48-B	i dont know he telling me this is told him you have to take permission from Dr.Taher because Dr.Taher there when the idea introduce in front of him
ar_7012.scr-340.54-341.01-A	yes
ar_7012.scr-340.85-343.86-B	so he said of course no, you are going to study, what if these countries there
ar_7012.scr-344.13-344.49-A	yes
ar_7012.scr-344.49-347.61-B	so I told him you are supposed to take, he told me I sent him but he didn't reply me
ar_7012.scr-347.94-349.45-B	that's all, so it seems he won't care about him
ar_7012.scr-349.51-349.98-A	M
ar_7012.scr-350.24-359.78-B	Yes but i told him that my casei am not faimaw and my subject isn't Cairo
ar_7012.scr-360.31-365.34-B	He can focus and write and stay on the details that he wants Ahmed am i correct or wrong
ar_7012.scr-364.55-365.61-A	Ah correct correct
ar_7012.scr-366.06-375.80-B	The important thing we finished talking he told that he felt like he was ashamed from him he was drawing a picture and i gave him a second picture i told him doctor Nihed i am not
ar_7012.scr-376.24-381.56-B	Be sure sir , a one lifted her house and her husband and her son and came her not for fun
ar_7012.scr-381.75-387.09-B	i dont know any one here i dont go out there is nothing i do except i read so iam not bother that i read
ar_7012.scr-387.37-397.25-B	but the idea Ahmad is that I am better, at least I m doing something for the thesis, for the goal which I came for, I told him, I am Muna Dr. Jihad, I came for the thesis, with full integrity
ar_7012.scr-397.70-403.41-B	like you say is over my head knowledge for knowledge but i have time so knowledge for knowledge
ar_7012.scr-403.45-410.99-B	now I have no time so this is not the right time to say knowledge for me  knowledge for knowledge when I finish the things I have
ar_7012.scr-411.74-417.75-B	and walked of course he is mad what matters that Mitwale today sat with him
ar_7012.scr-417.92-422.67-B	he tells me what while he is talking, no I mean he was not upset, let's say he had drawn a path
ar_7015.scr-502.14-506.09-A	if he was riding a car will he drive on roads like the these roads in Egypt
ar_7015.scr-506.10-508.57-B	yeah I understand this, means he will live nicely there
ar_7015.scr-506.52-510.30-A	if any problem happened to him for example
ar_7015.scr-510.63-513.63-A	his money was wasted and he didn't work
ar_7015.scr-513.88-518.34-A	what unemployment insurance there are things like that I mean there is there is there is
ar_7015.scr-516.33-520.89-B	of course you are correct the level right you are right the level of living here is very high
ar_7015.scr-520.58-522.13-A	yes yes fa fa fa
ar_7015.scr-521.60-522.39-B	but
ar_7015.scr-522.19-523.77-A	what <English I think> that he will not lose I mean
ar_7015.scr-523.66-526.28-B	but there are many Egyptians living at a better level
ar_7015.scr-526.80-527.75-A	Ok no problem
ar_7015.scr-527.85-529.75-B	so this is why the coming of those to Canada is meaningless
ar_7015.scr-530.11-533.55-B	their coming to Canada is meaningless and he is one of these, he intends to get back again
ar_7015.scr-534.00-536.12-B	he is intending to go back we talked with him for sometime he
ar_7015.scr-535.60-538.05-A	no no I want to tell you something there is there is a point that I want to tell you
ar_7015.scr-537.01-538.55-B	umm say
ar_7015.scr-538.54-544.68-A	most people once they come and face a trauma, and don't know what, they say I will go back, and this matter is not good and so on
ar_7015.scr-543.96-544.76-B	but later he stays
ar_7015.scr-545.03-545.91-A	but slowly
ar_7015.scr-545.97-547.26-B	he likes to stay
ar_7015.scr-546.26-551.22-A	and get used on the system, and forgets that thing, and merges, lives and issue is over
ar_7015.scr-551.30-552.00-B	he will like to stay
ar_7015.scr-552.06-555.38-A	it must be like that , you will not bring someone to...
ar_7015.scr-555.70-560.17-A	from some place and put him in another place he is not a mango tree for example
ar_7015.scr-560.26-560.81-B	perfect
ar_7015.scr-560.27-561.37-A	you will look and find that it would come at the end
ar_7015.scr-561.77-567.10-A	well even if a tree it is supposed to take time to adapt a little to the new environment where it is put in
ar_7015.scr-567.20-567.67-B	exactly
ar_7015.scr-567.58-567.87-A	and in
ar_7015.scr-567.81-568.13-B	exactly
ar_7015.scr-568.07-571.12-A	you try there would be rejection at the beginning, you will see its leafs became dry a little
ar_7015.scr-571.27-572.14-B	exactly
ar_7015.scr-571.36-572.95-A	then
ar_7015.scr-572.32-574.47-B	we will see, may God help, I
ar_7015.scr-573.82-581.06-A	or later it will start to go through the new environment, every human being who is coming to a new place must
ar_7015.scr-580.11-581.09-B	a natural reaction
ar_7015.scr-581.36-584.28-A	little rejection must happen at the beginning with him and so on
ar_7015.scr-584.57-586.05-A	little mess and
ar_7015.scr-585.02-586.68-B	little panic hmm
ar_7015.scr-586.34-590.52-A	then he will go on after that
ar_7015.scr-590.92-591.38-B	perfect
ar_7015.scr-591.01-593.72-A	it would become normal, this will be his life
ar_7015.scr-592.80-598.49-B	exactly, the important things after that sir we all went down to walk in one of the big commercial streets there
ar_7015.scr-598.41-598.85-A	umm
ar_7015.scr-599.08-603.03-B	and we got that jacket which I got sir, I mean frankly prices there
ar_7015.scr-603.11-608.38-B	are good but this is the most expensive thing I have seen in all the stores in the mall where we went
ar_7015.scr-607.83-610.39-A	where else did you go, else than this jacket matter which you bought
ar_7015.scr-610.42-613.09-B	We went after that my sir to downtown
ar_7015.scr-613.16-613.55-A	good
ar_7015.scr-613.69-617.87-B	we went there to an Indian store, he has very excellent food, the owner is Afghani
ar_7015.scr-618.22-618.53-A	sweet
ar_7015.scr-618.49-619.93-B	and he makes Halal food
ar_7015.scr-620.54-623.69-B	so the man frankly made a terrific variety for us, namely, chicken curry
ar_7015.scr-622.77-624.13-A	(( )) {breath} 
ar_7015.scr-624.13-627.90-B	on rice and vegetables, I mean it was very tasty
ar_7015.scr-628.18-631.01-B	and full with acceptable Egyptian taste, I mean acceptable Egyptian taste
ar_7015.scr-631.44-636.99-B	and the man was very witty, the owner too, and all this was for very cheap price, five dollars for the whole thing
ar_7015.scr-637.14-641.53-B	so it was a good thing, we ended the day with it, after that they lift me till
ar_7015.scr-640.97-644.05-A	nothing, did you go young street
ar_7015.scr-643.43-649.32-B	all this was in young street, this man is on young street intersection with Plure, with a street called Plure

ar_7015.scr-659.47-660.88-B	this isn't us I mean
ar_7015.scr-660.60-662.33-A	{laugh} 
ar_7015.scr-661.82-662.95-B	anyhow may God
ar_7015.scr-662.50-664.92-A	by the way I met Sajif today
ar_7015.scr-664.96-665.37-B	hmm
