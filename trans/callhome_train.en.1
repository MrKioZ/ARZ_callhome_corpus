ar_4150.scr-1192.20-1197.72-B1	No what! they were in quarrels because she wanted to go Aida; and he did not want her to go so that she does not meet with boys
ar_4150.scr-1198.12-1205.66-A	How coward! It's right that this girl from before she didn't talk expect for her dad, and no one really knows about her
ar_4150.scr-1198.46-1199.95-B1	so they were arguing
ar_4150.scr-1202.06-1204.52-B1	exactly , basically
ar_4150.scr-1205.91-1220.29-B1	with no identity . it was a tragedy , but anyway she called me ans she kept telling me for half an hour what should i do and what should I not to do , of course if i have told her that was it , or if  they divorce me  because of that
ar_4150.scr-1207.81-1208.69-A	Unknown
ar_4150.scr-1215.64-1216.65-A	as such
ar_4150.scr-1220.61-1230.25-B1	So of course I told her no that's excellent ((waDac)) {laugh} excellent here for us no no no oh my daughter this is the greatest thing in this world and I convinced her what matter is that they reconciled at the end after [distortion]
ar_4150.scr-1219.45-1224.61-A	{laugh}
ar_4150.scr-1228.32-1231.89-A	as for this, Yosra, he's a European in the middle of his brothers
ar_4150.scr-1232.29-1234.23-B1	European of course very European
ar_4150.scr-1233.31-1235.13-A	because you was very free
ar_4150.scr-1235.37-1241.66-B1	Yes and basically (-ir$) she basically goes and stand with who basically with Sharif Zainhum; and Ahmad Karim and these are those whom Shirin knows Zaimhum (-mit)
ar_4150.scr-1241.14-1245.35-A	do they even know her, it's good, no one knows this girl on earth
ar_4150.scr-1243.35-1244.46-B1	Yes they know her
ar_4150.scr-1245.54-1251.77-B1	No no it appeared that she told me I go and stand with who, because I stand with good boys I go to stand with Sharif Zainhum; Ahmad Karim and Ashraf Gazayerly.
ar_4150.scr-1246.17-1246.78-A	(( ))
ar_4150.scr-1252.48-1254.72-A	OK what stops her for example with Sherif Zenhm Ahmad Kareem and so
ar_4150.scr-1255.77-1257.89-B1	Only so these are whom she knows so basically
ar_4150.scr-1257.45-1259.20-A	but this I mean its OK with those
ar_4150.scr-1259.66-1267.18-B1	Because because it is not a problem for her but a problem for Sharif so she (-mi$) basically when she found that I went to the park, I was (-b) So she found me I was greeting Ashraf and
ar_4150.scr-1265.89-1267.47-A	and standing in the middle of them and so
ar_4150.scr-1267.79-1280.53-B1	Yeah, so I mean I found out that Yosri by himself was in the middle of all of it... mhm! he was not taken into account, so what matters is that they reconciled, but what happened, when Douha found out about the dispute he delayed the engagement.
ar_4150.scr-1272.13-1273.22-A	yeah
ar_4150.scr-1280.88-1281.64-A	Who is this?

ar_4150.scr-1291.73-1303.56-B1	Yes so he thought that the engagement could be broken so he preferred to postpone the engagement all the people in Alexandria; are talking about the fact that it is not possible for (( )) and Kretam; not possible to live with each other and they broke the engagement
ar_4150.scr-1292.44-1294.04-A	yeah
ar_4150.scr-1304.82-1306.65-B1	This is what is commonly said in the country ya-
ar_4150.scr-1306.17-1308.21-A	and it looks like it's over
ar_4150.scr-1308.97-1317.92-B1	What! I swear no I mean really after this quarrel the guy was treating the girl very vadly he was not expressing to her and neglecting her might stay for a week without seeing her nor expressing to her
ar_4150.scr-1309.07-1310.40-A	NA
ar_4150.scr-1317.31-1323.94-A	so why don't he get engaged to her. Or leave each other, this is very strange

ar_4194.scr-1377.15-1377.49-A	what
ar_4194.scr-1377.26-1382.33-B1	this as itself will worsen the reputation of the rest of the buildings

ar_4299.scr-925.90-935.15-A	OK so the issue is that I do not want to do something and I will never do something that makes you angry and makes you take a situation against me or
ar_4299.scr-934.63-951.08-B	enough God forgive you and you could make it up to her by money then the distance is hundred thousands or tens of thousands of kilometers and enough I mean not the first people to know each other and split

ar_4299.scr-989.93-990.63-A	enough
ar_4299.scr-990.06-1001.54-B	I told you also you are free to marry her I am not like the father that say if you get married to this you are not my son and I don't know you or what and don't marry this one
ar_4299.scr-999.92-1005.04-A	no you can't I mean from far you might talk but I
ar_4299.scr-1004.87-1009.31-B	it's not a matter of far or near I'm broad minded
ar_4299.scr-1009.73-1018.36-B	and what I appreciate the circumstances and there will be soon time that there won't be marriage they will live together
ar_4299.scr-1018.52-1023.85-B	and there in Europe and America they live like that while people we are Muslims and we know God well
ar_4299.scr-1024.46-1030.86-B	what's wrong if you did her wrong and gave her a promise and
ar_4299.scr-1029.49-1040.90-A	I feel in Arabic this feeling of guilt to leave someone I promised or didn't promise I mean I promised him as if you agreed Ok I feel guilty that I can help someone and

ar_4299.scr-1058.31-1065.90-B	god is merciful and you didn't commit a crime or something if you read the paper you'd know..
ar_4299.scr-1065.94-1070.62-B	what young people do now and men but god is keeping us away from all this
ar_4299.scr-1069.49-1074.07-A	they do whatever they want dad but each one and his conscience dad
ar_4299.scr-1072.30-1082.44-B	OK and I am telling you your conscience anyway ma- ma- ma- will not reprove you so that you suicide or ti- ti- ti- ti- ti- --

ar_4299.scr-1096.53-1107.98-B	and then if you feel guilt make up make up for her with money make up with anything and God will give her someone better than you not like you better
ar_4299.scr-1106.05-1110.02-A	the problem is I am Afraid Afraid as God is there also

ar_4299.scr-1110.59-1112.11-A	I fear god
ar_4299.scr-1112.92-1124.13-B	god is the most merciful and if you did wrong pray and ask for forgiveness and give to charity and give her money and everything you haven't committed a major crime
ar_4299.scr-1125.52-1125.92-A	Yes, but
ar_4299.scr-1125.50-1133.79-B	all there is is that you're separating and it's for the best instead of having  a kid or two or ten or twenty and the separate and the kids become the victims

ar_4542.scr-232.32-232.90-B	yes
ar_4542.scr-234.10-237.08-B	no this s what I was about to talk to you about
ar_4542.scr-237.10-237.78-A	what
ar_4542.scr-237.73-245.73-B	the school wants to put him in pre-school, they won't us to sign a declaration that they're not responsible for entering him into first grade next year
ar_4542.scr-245.73-246.14-A	Why
ar_4542.scr-246.59-247.81-B	And of course I do not agree
ar_4542.scr-247.97-248.45-A	Why , is that
ar_4542.scr-248.36-251.82-B	So what we try is to get an intermediary through the father of aunt Zozo;
ar_4542.scr-251.93-252.42-A	Yeah
ar_4542.scr-252.96-261.39-B	I want to take your opinion, if this intermediary didn't work what should i do? The Zainy is willing to babysit him but of course after that he should go the first grade school
ar_4542.scr-261.53-262.97-A	Yes why he
ar_4542.scr-262.59-265.05-B	But in il- ((glI)) what
ar_4542.scr-263.07-266.18-A	I mean why the Muslim generation does not agree I mean the Muslim generation does not agree
ar_4542.scr-265.58-270.69-B	the Muslim generation first year of Kindergarten and don't want to enter kindergaren
ar_4542.scr-271.14-271.47-A	okay
ar_4542.scr-272.75-273.42-A	NA
ar_4542.scr-272.62-280.29-B	or I have to sign a sanction that I agree that he starts at KG1 and the school is not responsible that he starts primary school next year because he's gonna be 6 years old next year
ar_4542.scr-280.47-284.33-A	so why wouldn't he enter, what's their problem exactly
ar_4542.scr-281.03-281.35-B	should be
ar_4542.scr-283.90-293.62-B	they're complicating it, since day one they haven't made things easy for me. When I first came I wanted first pre-school, but they said school has already started and it won't work. I'm paying you so he should get in.
ar_4542.scr-291.64-291.88-A	mm
ar_4542.scr-294.79-295.52-A	mm
ar_4542.scr-293.97-301.22-B	there's no other places I made some connections and got a letter from the dean to get him into KG 2 and the reply came on the 1st of august
ar_4542.scr-301.26-301.60-A	mm
ar_4542.scr-301.49-309.03-B	they also call telling that I should write a confirmation that he enter first year nursery and we are not responsible to make him enter first grade what do you think
ar_4542.scr-309.00-309.49-A	na
ar_4542.scr-309.12-312.16-B	Aiman was accepted and allowance was paid
ar_4542.scr-311.76-312.74-A	OK its like that
ar_4542.scr-312.35-317.10-B	and told them that he has a brother aged five years you might takle with you last year of kindergarten
ar_4542.scr-317.13-317.46-A	m
ar_4542.scr-317.72-323.28-B	they told me maybe they accept for his circumstances they take Arabic and English here next to us
ar_4542.scr-323.17-323.72-A	yes yes
ar_4542.scr-323.96-327.30-B	and after that he can go to any elementary school
ar_4542.scr-327.47-331.98-A	Yes I mean in both cases either he went to Alzeni or he went to their nursery and
ar_4542.scr-331.04-331.51-B	yes
ar_4542.scr-331.57-334.81-B	so I don't know what you think
ar_4542.scr-334.59-341.65-A	let him be there, so if something happens he might enter primary school, if it doesn't work then it's all the same
ar_4542.scr-342.57-343.58-A	so if we leave him
ar_4542.scr-342.80-346.24-B	the difference in from seven hundred to one hundred and fifty
ar_4542.scr-347.21-355.10-A	it is not about the money the money is not important he is available and he would reserve a place and he has the  priority to enter first grade
ar_4542.scr-346.90-349.58-B	[background] Yes!
ar_4542.scr-354.72-359.21-B	but he's gonna start primary school when he's seven
ar_4542.scr-357.37-360.93-A	No if I cannot make him join next year I will send him to another school outside and that is it
ar_4542.scr-361.44-366.80-B	I mean if the connections didn't work I'll pay the fees for KG 1
ar_4542.scr-367.18-369.53-A	I mean try you have priority
ar_4542.scr-369.16-370.17-B	OK if it did happen
ar_4542.scr-369.83-372.31-A	I mean they now if ((xallIna bass))
ar_4542.scr-370.50-372.87-B	[background/] Do you know that the expenses should be paid before the study [/background]
ar_4542.scr-372.77-378.61-A	let me finish if they accepted him in KG 1 he'll continue he has to go to KG 2
ar_4542.scr-375.12-375.43-B	yes
ar_4542.scr-377.78-381.56-B	he will enter second preschool except for one condition
ar_4542.scr-380.02-380.40-A	yes
ar_4542.scr-381.51-381.92-A	Yeah
ar_4542.scr-382.08-388.65-B	If there will be a vacancy in the middle of the year for example a child [background] whose paperwork is withdrawn because he is traveling or someone who sent his son out from the school
ar_4542.scr-388.75-390.01-A	they will move him to preschool
ar_4542.scr-389.10-390.69-B	So this is of course a good condition
ar_4542.scr-390.65-391.61-A	Then they will move him to KG two
ar_4542.scr-391.96-393.00-B	Yes this is this year
ar_4542.scr-393.09-393.55-A	yeah
ar_4542.scr-393.66-400.28-B	also the primary school thing I mean that he transfers to a primary school if there's something like that
ar_4542.scr-401.69-406.91-A	I mean if he continued he could go to KG 1 for the whole year then starts primary one if there's a vacant place
ar_4542.scr-407.11-415.00-B	yeah but that's a very slim shot I mean why would they want me to sign a sanction to void them of any responsibility so that you wouldn't go and tell them why won't he go to primary one
ar_4542.scr-412.24-412.70-A	Mm!
ar_4542.scr-415.19-418.74-A	so why not see this connection and end all this pay a bit extra
ar_4542.scr-418.03-419.59-B	OK what if this intermediary did not work
ar_4542.scr-420.07-420.33-A	what
ar_4542.scr-420.36-422.96-B	let him start KG 1 there or what
ar_4542.scr-422.99-425.00-A	Make them even pay some extra money no problem
ar_4542.scr-425.39-425.86-B	what
ar_4542.scr-425.77-427.66-A	let them pay extra money a little its not a case
ar_4542.scr-428.13-434.53-B	They bi- I hope this was the story I told you I went the first time once I came so that he joins KG one and addIl- and pay the expenses for him even if he would not attend
ar_4542.scr-433.47-433.76-A	Mm!
ar_4542.scr-434.79-435.16-A	Yeah!
ar_4542.scr-435.06-437.68-B	They did not accept they are complicating it so much honestly I do not know what is that
ar_4542.scr-437.85-440.50-A	Yes because they're the one ones
ar_4542.scr-439.89-445.93-B	If we knew this would happen before we went there, we would reserve or something, but we didn't know any better
ar_4542.scr-445.90-447.87-A	we didn't know it would go this way
ar_4542.scr-448.00-448.33-B	yeah
ar_4542.scr-448.33-451.31-A	I don't know I can't..
ar_4542.scr-451.03-456.46-B	so now if he didn't go to primary school next year we will have to take him to any other school
ar_4542.scr-457.01-462.29-A	yes I swear and leave him there till god help us and find a solution
ar_4542.scr-462.39-464.46-B	I mean we let him in if the kid..
ar_4542.scr-464.03-467.21-A	may be we'll find him a solution by the time come or somthing
ar_4542.scr-467.66-468.02-B	Mm!
ar_4542.scr-468.02-471.82-A	I mean ba- if we (( )) make him quit now it would be a problem that we would not be able to make him join again
ar_4542.scr-472.18-472.57-B	yeah
ar_4542.scr-472.62-476.45-A	He is available there... If we found a way to move it i think it should work
ar_4542.scr-476.96-477.61-B	how so
ar_4542.scr-477.92-481.34-A	you don't get me, i mean for example his presence at school
ar_4542.scr-480.92-482.94-B	yes so it just exists
ar_4542.scr-482.89-488.91-A	has a place at least, the thing about getting him in next year is a bit easier than starting all over
ar_4542.scr-489.13-491.30-B	OK and if they insisted that i write the approval then i will
ar_4542.scr-491.12-492.87-A	Yes but you will have to write it, so he could get in
ar_4542.scr-493.33-493.63-B	Yes!
ar_4542.scr-493.65-499.79-A	but try as much as possible not to write approval  and enter it even if money was paid increase  offer
ar_4542.scr-499.14-501.58-B	this topic bothers me very frankly
ar_4542.scr-501.12-505.23-A	of course, do not need any talk display they that pay to one or two times no problem
ar_4542.scr-505.63-506.01-B	what
ar_4542.scr-506.16-509.77-A	I mean make them the offer that you pay them 1000 pounds instead of 700 make them 1000
ar_4542.scr-510.97-519.55-B	They won't agree.. He is Sunni, and not from the other Islamic group from that Sayed the deceitful
ar_4542.scr-520.00-523.18-A	yeah who's the dean who knows him I mean is there any..
