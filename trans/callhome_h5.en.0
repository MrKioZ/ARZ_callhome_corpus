ar_7012.scr-291.12-297.73-B	I found that Ahmad I am wasting my time as if I am entering the exam so I found that I won't fool my self
ar_7012.scr-298.03-303.39-B	I told him doctor I don't object to take courses I will take course but as an audit he said what is the difference
ar_7012.scr-303.60-311.54-B	I said the difference as an audit the topics that I will find my self in isn't this area of mine for my major as the problem gets out

ar_7012.scr-349.51-349.98-A	m
ar_7012.scr-350.24-359.78-B	so I said to me the case that I am not regional and my topic is not Cairo objecting I just take one which is audit
ar_7012.scr-360.31-365.34-B	he can focus or right in the details that he wants Ahmad or am I wrong
ar_7012.scr-364.55-365.61-A	yes right right
ar_7012.scr-366.06-375.80-B	what matters is that we are done I felt that he was depressed from me honestly he had an image or the doctor gave him an image and said Doctor Nihad I am not kidding
ar_7012.scr-376.24-381.56-B	make sure you she left her home and her son and came to
ar_7012.scr-381.75-387.09-B	I don't know anyone here that don't get there isn't a thing I do but I read I am not mad I just read the contrary
ar_7012.scr-387.37-397.25-B	but the idea at least Ahmad I do a thing as the message for the purpose that I came for I said Mona doctor Nihad I am coming honestly
ar_7012.scr-397.70-403.41-B	like you say knowledge for knowdledge and my head from above I have no time then knowledge for knowledge
ar_7012.scr-403.45-410.99-B	now i have no time its not the right time that I say knowdledge for knowledge when I finish things I have I will look for knowledge for knowledge
ar_7012.scr-411.74-417.75-B	and I walked and I don't know of course he got mad what matters I mean that Mitwale today sat with him
ar_7012.scr-417.92-422.67-B	he says that he talk I mean he didn't get mad like you are saying he have a way
ar_7015.scr-502.14-506.09-A	if he rides a car he will walk the road compared to these roads in Egypt
ar_7015.scr-506.10-508.57-B	yes I understand he won't live well I mean
ar_7015.scr-506.52-510.30-A	what if any problems happened to him for example
ar_7015.scr-510.63-513.63-A	his money was wasted and he don't use it
ar_7015.scr-513.88-518.34-A	the unemployment insurace there are things like that there is there is there are benefits
ar_7015.scr-516.33-520.89-B	you are right of course you are right living standards here is high
ar_7015.scr-520.58-522.13-A	yes yes
ar_7015.scr-521.60-522.39-B	but

ar_7015.scr-523.66-526.28-B	but there are many Egyptians living in a way better than this
ar_7015.scr-526.80-527.75-A	there is no problem
ar_7015.scr-527.85-529.75-B	for that they live in Kanada and it has no meaning
ar_7015.scr-530.11-533.55-B	Coming to Canada has no meaning and he is one of those he wants to get back again
ar_7015.scr-534.00-536.12-B	he wants to come back and set we talked a little to him

ar_7015.scr-543.96-544.76-B	but then he sets
ar_7015.scr-545.03-545.91-A	but little by little
ar_7015.scr-545.97-547.26-B	he likes to set
ar_7015.scr-546.26-551.22-A	and take the system and take the situation and forget this and cope and live and that is it
