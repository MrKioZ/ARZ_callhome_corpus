ar_5838.scr-894.01-894.87-B	you see
ar_5838.scr-895.25-897.28-A	buth when you want to change oil
ar_5838.scr-897.43-897.93-B	m
ar_5838.scr-898.19-899.64-A	you take off the filter right
ar_5838.scr-900.15-901.02-B	or the
ar_5838.scr-901.27-901.98-A	should
ar_5838.scr-901.29-902.45-B	should change filter
ar_5838.scr-902.55-906.66-A	then you install a new filter and then you have three
ar_5838.scr-906.79-907.22-B	yes

ar_5838.scr-908.58-909.05-A	no
ar_5838.scr-909.30-909.83-B	what then
ar_5838.scr-909.56-911.55-A	for that I am telling you don't take three and a half
ar_5838.scr-911.79-912.30-B	why
ar_5838.scr-912.42-914.22-A	when you install a new filter
ar_5838.scr-914.38-914.79-B	m
ar_5838.scr-914.42-915.74-A	the filter is empty
ar_5838.scr-915.83-916.30-B	m
ar_5838.scr-917.37-922.56-A	I mean say that to guarantee that the oil is new without taking off the filter
ar_5838.scr-923.40-927.71-A	you will find the pump took the oil that you have and threw them out
ar_5838.scr-927.57-932.64-B	no this is risky risky to empty and run the motor some people do that
ar_5838.scr-930.98-935.24-A	no its seconds seconds seconds its seconds
ar_5838.scr-935.57-939.68-B	yes but there are people that do that so that they don't take the rist even you
ar_5838.scr-940.00-942.43-B	run it without oil for seconds
ar_5838.scr-943.12-947.19-B	they have after the oil is empty well
ar_5838.scr-947.12-947.40-A	m
ar_5838.scr-947.95-956.03-B	he go and bring the new Coord and throw it and open it to empty it

ar_5838.scr-965.70-966.24-B	m
ar_5838.scr-966.28-967.17-A	its name dank
ar_5838.scr-967.44-967.93-B	m
ar_5838.scr-967.84-970.03-A	you will find quarter a gallon like the gas
ar_5838.scr-969.27-970.71-B	m
ar_5838.scr-970.65-973.37-A	not just gas its chemical I mean its
ar_5838.scr-972.14-974.95-B	m m m
ar_5838.scr-974.51-979.94-A	before changing oil you throw it in the motor and run it for five or ten minutes
ar_5838.scr-979.99-980.52-B	m
ar_5838.scr-980.19-982.27-A	the chemical will clean all the line
ar_5838.scr-982.46-983.35-B	m
ar_5838.scr-982.99-987.28-A	and clean the trash that is in the engine then check oil you will find it drained

ar_5838.scr-989.82-996.27-A	anyway when you take down the filter and install a new filter and replace the oil you should run the motor for quarter a minute
ar_5838.scr-996.34-997.02-B	m
ar_5838.scr-996.81-1001.38-A	because oil will be bad and will hit the lines all
ar_5838.scr-1001.42-1002.10-B	m
ar_5838.scr-1001.83-1006.11-A	will get to the filter then you measure the oil you will find it missing like half
