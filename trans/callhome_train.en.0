ar_4542.scr-334.59-341.65-A	I swear to god I think he should stay there then if any circumstances happened he can enter first grade and if nothing happened he can stay here in elementary school and the is enough they all look alike
ar_4542.scr-342.57-343.58-A	I mean if we
ar_4542.scr-342.80-346.24-B	then the
ar_4542.scr-347.21-355.10-A	the idea is not in the money won't matter the idea that there he reserved the place and he have priority
ar_4542.scr-346.90-349.58-B	yes

ar_4542.scr-367.18-369.53-A	I mean try first and that is it
ar_4542.scr-369.16-370.17-B	OK if it didn't happen
ar_4542.scr-369.83-372.31-A	I mean they are now
ar_4542.scr-370.50-372.87-B	you know that the fees must be paid before school starts
ar_4542.scr-372.77-378.61-A	Let me continue if they let him join KG one then they should continue the second year HaDa-
ar_4542.scr-375.12-375.43-B	Yes
ar_4542.scr-377.78-381.56-B	He will join ((baqa Eh)) KG 2 except in one case only
ar_4542.scr-380.02-380.40-A	Yeah!
ar_4542.scr-381.51-381.92-A	yes
ar_4542.scr-382.08-388.65-B	if a place opened up in the middle of the year, like if a kid leaves because he travels or someone took their kid out of school
ar_4542.scr-388.75-390.01-A	Then they will move him to KG two
ar_4542.scr-389.10-390.69-B	so this is a condition
ar_4542.scr-390.65-391.61-A	they will transfer him to another preschook

ar_4542.scr-401.69-406.91-A	so if he finishes, he can finish first grade and then first grade in elementary school if there is room
ar_4542.scr-407.11-415.00-B	yes, but this is very, very low probability  why do they want me to write ratification why , to empty their responsibility even do not say why will not enter the first Primary

ar_4751.scr-290.84-294.08-B	yes!
ar_4751.scr-292.00-304.81-A	so I asked himself if go to Egypt to make an interview {laugh}, and what if they don't recruit me after that journey, no I'm doing fine here thanks God
ar_4751.scr-304.60-319.69-B	I swear Mohamed if you are doing fine over there, it's much better than coming back, but the important thing is to visit here every year
ar_4751.scr-305.75-314.82-A	mm no thank god
ar_4751.scr-318.95-321.61-A	I can come to Egypt you see but..
ar_4751.scr-320.75-322.28-B	then why don't you come
ar_4751.scr-322.50-326.74-A	the thing is ..what
ar_4751.scr-325.60-328.03-B	the money
ar_4751.scr-327.88-332.52-A	he'll say money again
ar_4751.scr-332.17-334.70-B	no be frank it's okay I'm asking you
ar_4751.scr-333.56-342.55-A	no no no not that I swear but the thing is I don't know, there's nothing, what, I came back to..
ar_4751.scr-341.81-342.97-B	to get you attached to Egypt
ar_4751.scr-343.28-352.25-A	not my bond, I went there got married and moved on, then I found that to go for a visit I had to bring my family, which is a financial burden
ar_4751.scr-352.74-353.81-B	yes of course!
ar_4751.scr-352.75-362.03-A	so it'll cost like 5000 dollars so you find yourself spending 5000 dollar just to come back and stay for a month and then go back again, also when you come back to Egypt you find that everyone's busy
ar_4751.scr-362.71-369.17-B	no but the good thing about it is to be close to the market in Egypt and to know all about the system and the people and such
ar_4751.scr-369.10-370.21-A	that's the point
ar_4751.scr-369.57-373.31-B	and when you come and stay, aren't you planning and settle in Egypt later on or what
ar_4751.scr-372.59-373.43-A	yes God willing!
ar_4751.scr-374.25-380.38-B	so you will need to know everything about Egypt, how could this happen if you were completely detached
ar_4751.scr-379.79-380.90-A	I don't know
ar_4751.scr-380.52-387.12-B	In order to adapt yourself to the life conditions, you have to come at least every two years
ar_4751.scr-383.09-391.45-A	Mm! anyway a- anyway I try in God's will in God's will anyway Ha- in God's will I will try to come in the coming period
ar_4751.scr-387.83-400.51-B	[background] Mm! [background] in God's will [background]
ar_4751.scr-392.11-401.77-A	In God's will but this is {cough} this is the issue anyway that is it uh! other than that I am good here I mean not not bad
ar_4751.scr-401.26-407.45-B	I say to you it is expatriation here and over there [distortion] but as you ((bitqUl bass $ahr fi il+sanaB)) [/distortion]

ar_4778.scr-609.70-609.98-A	Yeah!
ar_4778.scr-610.77-612.51-B	a car for one hundred pounds per day, why?
ar_4778.scr-611.95-614.05-A	{laugh} that's the system
ar_4778.scr-615.65-616.39-B	no kidding
ar_4778.scr-616.67-621.69-A	no kidding, I even said she could have taken my car instead, I don't use it

ar_4778.scr-626.71-626.94-A	yeah
ar_4778.scr-626.71-627.62-B	it's must be a beetle
ar_4778.scr-627.95-631.52-A	it is a beetle she says I won't be able to move in Egypt without a car
ar_4778.scr-632.60-633.11-B	(())
ar_4778.scr-632.30-634.59-A	and between me and you what was said is right but
ar_4778.scr-634.32-635.02-B	NA
ar_4778.scr-634.63-638.67-A	also the solution that you spend five thousand pounds in renting a car also strange
ar_4778.scr-640.18-644.95-B	yes no I mean we should also take the new
ar_4778.scr-645.00-647.66-B	I mean no I don't know
ar_4778.scr-646.98-652.91-A	yes as I mean if you started saying I don't know Alla and how much he takes
ar_4778.scr-653.30-655.71-A	but if Alaa takes ten thousand Rial for example
ar_4778.scr-656.17-660.35-A	I mean he tells you for example five thousand pounds its wage for half a month not an issue I mean
ar_4778.scr-662.01-662.88-B	you remember
ar_4778.scr-662.68-664.41-A	for example I don't know
ar_4778.scr-664.55-665.49-B	maybe of course
ar_4778.scr-665.86-667.61-B	maybe yes of course maybe maybe
ar_4778.scr-666.02-666.49-A	I mean
ar_4778.scr-667.99-670.12-B	maybe no but a beetle
ar_4778.scr-670.80-671.59-B	I mean
ar_4778.scr-669.78-677.97-A	but I mean other than that I mean maybe I think to buy a car for example if god wants for twenty thousand and sell it in the end and would have lose in it
ar_4778.scr-678.34-680.91-A	-- It is not more than one thousand pounds anyway and she will take four anyway
ar_4778.scr-680.13-680.34-B	Yes
ar_4778.scr-680.62-686.97-B	no sure for them I mean maybe take a car that anyone also rent it but it won't be for five thousand pounds I don;t know I don't know
ar_4778.scr-686.89-693.29-A	I mean the important, I tell you there is things that stay I mean you can't let it goes in any meaning
ar_4778.scr-693.51-694.29-B	no
ar_4778.scr-693.82-695.74-A	try to get excuses
ar_4778.scr-695.17-698.67-B	No basically if you are in her situation you would not do that so you become
ar_4778.scr-698.59-699.02-A	yes
ar_4778.scr-698.78-706.53-B	the topic is well he had fun I mean yes and of course I was excited to know the news of mariam and Moshaera with some
ar_4778.scr-706.62-708.15-B	the week that they take
ar_4778.scr-707.96-709.48-A	they never meet each other
ar_4778.scr-709.68-711.53-B	I don't know, no, sure they met each other but I mean
ar_4778.scr-710.82-712.37-A	no they've never met
ar_4778.scr-713.06-721.26-B	no the day we went me and Mona and Hala and Mushira, Mariam met them once at Hisham's when we went to him

ar_4899.scr-1271.86-1281.54-B	OK but believe me that the transportation and not having abilities that he asked about for example this is what stops her
ar_4899.scr-1280.08-1280.54-A	mm
ar_4899.scr-1282.09-1292.19-B	her attitude towards her surroundings and to be good at certain stuffs , not to be lazy and all these things even if she is divorced she may her chance

ar_4899.scr-1465.76-1469.64-B	Your job it supposed that it's income is good I think
ar_4899.scr-1470.09-1472.61-A	not not not the amount of work I get tired in

ar_4899.scr-1477.88-1479.79-A	yes as in Egypt there is no work for me at all
ar_4899.scr-1480.33-1487.24-B	Fine no about li- it is not a matter of I have a job or I don't have a job, the matter of it's income suppose that you have a job here it won't be like it's money there
ar_4899.scr-1484.56-1484.89-A	M!
ar_4899.scr-1487.11-1499.11-A	Yes, i do compare between two things, that either i go to Egypt and sit at home not do anything and that means i won't have money of my own to spend on myself, or stay here and work like a donkey and can afford...

ar_4899.scr-1507.91-1509.76-B	You know that if you started to save right when you got there...
ar_4899.scr-1509.83-1510.38-A	Mhm!
ar_4899.scr-1510.53-1518.71-B	Long time ago you used to stay in Egypt with whatever you had at home, and study something you like and work on something that you like and still make money
ar_4899.scr-1515.97-1516.34-A	Mhm!
ar_4899.scr-1517.89-1521.94-A	Because I recompense the years of deprivation that I lived in Saudi
ar_4899.scr-1522.91-1523.53-A	i'm actually redeeming for the years of misery i've lived in Saudi arabia
ar_4899.scr-1523.06-1525.71-B	OK enough compensation for you, now to how many years you will stay compensating in America

ar_4899.scr-1536.41-1540.41-B	frankly,this idea, if i was able to accomplish it, i would have a long time ago
ar_4899.scr-1540.72-1541.19-A	M!
ar_4899.scr-1541.03-1550.99-B	America; America; but the important thing is that I am, what! the idea of that this time that we live in, because the job is disgusting and il- and life is no more easy like past and that one can find a something like a convenient job
ar_4899.scr-1550.97-1551.34-A	M!
ar_4899.scr-1551.12-1556.19-B	And it's income is good and after that he find time for himself and all these are no longer existing and life became harsh and like that
ar_4899.scr-1554.89-1555.29-A	Yes! [distortion]
ar_4899.scr-1556.42-1556.83-A	M!

ar_4899.scr-1561.22-1564.88-A	OK the Arab countries don't they take or what
ar_4899.scr-1566.28-1569.41-B	no their circumstance are bad no as their salary is weak
ar_4899.scr-1569.67-1570.19-A	m
ar_4899.scr-1570.71-1573.62-B	and the humiliation and Egyptians being hated and things
ar_4899.scr-1572.53-1576.84-A	and ask for a lot of years of experience I mean
ar_4899.scr-1577.38-1578.88-B	Because now I have a lot
ar_4899.scr-1579.09-1583.88-A	OK apply just get your feet there then God solve it
ar_4899.scr-1584.11-1586.96-B	I did that years ago, honestly, and not today
ar_4899.scr-1586.67-1587.12-A	Mhm!
ar_4899.scr-1588.12-1593.94-B	Yeah but now you are... well if you don't know what to tell you... if  you try harder and save the money
ar_4899.scr-1594.33-1597.42-B	And forget about the making it up story

ar_4899.scr-1616.46-1616.83-A	Mhm!
ar_4899.scr-1616.34-1621.88-B	But there is something in people when they talk about memory and thoughts and all that stuff
ar_4899.scr-1618.09-1618.28-A	Mhm!
ar_4899.scr-1622.01-1633.06-B	The studies say and i've practicing it for sure, and there is no comparison between something you want to remember while you're liking it and interested in it and something else that you don't like and not interested in it and don't understand it

ar_4949.scr-646.87-651.83-B	I I have nothing to do with this issue, if he thing that there is god, god is there
ar_4949.scr-651.96-658.91-B	go and ask him Hoda, as long as you all have forgotten that God exists; ask his worshipers, maybe someone of you still remember God
ar_4949.scr-659.61-661.79-B	since you say it never happened Abdalla
ar_4949.scr-662.19-673.19-B	and then once you said no don't give her the thousand pound when they are thousand and five hundred and now she says that I told him not to give her I don't know what you talked its all wrong and lies

ar_4981.scr-279.32-285.96-B	E- he is offensive and he considers that all people should bear him and his shouts so she felt unfair
ar_4981.scr-286.50-289.48-B	She said I was never insulted why does he keep insulting me
ar_4981.scr-289.54-291.16-A	Why does he insult her I mean what is the reason
