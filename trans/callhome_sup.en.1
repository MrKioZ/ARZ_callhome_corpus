ar_5808.scr-541.90-542.35-A	umm
ar_5808.scr-542.32-542.74-B	umm
ar_5808.scr-543.17-545.75-A	it fall before that actually after that it melted next day
ar_5808.scr-545.43-546.36-B	yes yes
ar_5808.scr-546.14-548.80-A	it melted the same day because it wasn't cold enough
ar_5808.scr-548.71-549.30-B	mm
ar_5808.scr-549.53-554.25-A	but yesterday it was snowing a lot yesterday was weird
ar_5808.scr-554.44-554.78-B	hmm
ar_5808.scr-554.43-559.46-A	it was raining in the morning and temperature was in the tens
ar_5808.scr-559.29-560.37-B	mm
ar_5808.scr-560.21-564.07-A	i mean it wasn't that cold it was a normal cold
ar_5808.scr-564.05-564.60-B	yes
ar_5808.scr-564.71-567.13-A	but then it was raining a lot
ar_5808.scr-567.42-568.02-B	umm
ar_5808.scr-567.68-571.73-A	after that at night for example, at seven o'clock or so
ar_5808.scr-570.47-572.25-B	[distortion] 
ar_5808.scr-572.03-574.54-A	suddenly the temperature started to fall below zero
ar_5808.scr-575.20-581.51-A	then it stayed, I mean this raining continued it seems, all the time and then became snow
ar_5808.scr-582.60-583.64-B	umm
ar_5808.scr-583.02-589.20-A	so the snow became too much, big amount, therefor today at morning everything was covered in s now, in everywhere I mean
ar_5808.scr-589.07-590.66-B	but it is still early for this snow
ar_5808.scr-591.08-593.00-A	they are saying
ar_5808.scr-592.20-595.02-B	like maybe one and a half month early
ar_5808.scr-595.02-597.10-A	no not really one and a h alf month
ar_5808.scr-596.00-598.98-B	I mean it is mid of December when it starts to snow
ar_5808.scr-599.14-599.82-A	where is the
ar_5808.scr-600.05-601.48-B	it is supposed to be mid of December
ar_5808.scr-602.00-605.73-A	yes I mean that I don't know, maybe the snow here is a bit more than with you
ar_5808.scr-605.73-606.70-B	maybe yes
ar_5808.scr-606.52-608.60-A	but still it is just I mean
ar_5808.scr-608.70-610.11-B	with you it is colder than here
ar_5808.scr-609.94-612.17-A	yes it is considered so here
ar_5808.scr-612.30-612.78-B	[background] 
ar_5808.scr-612.64-615.65-A	a bit early that it falls much like this in the
ar_5808.scr-612.78-615.65-B	hmm
ar_5808.scr-617.36-617.86-B	mm
ar_5808.scr-618.62-620.96-A	it did not fall yet over there at all
ar_5808.scr-620.62-624.93-B	now some snow fell a little but it was soft but it went away directly
ar_5808.scr-625.14-625.64-A	hmm
ar_5808.scr-625.24-628.19-B	also the temperature went below zero
ar_5808.scr-628.35-628.89-A	hmm
ar_5808.scr-628.77-630.82-B	below which means thirty two
ar_5808.scr-630.96-631.47-A	hmm
ar_5808.scr-631.55-640.56-B	but today it went back a little i mean seven or eight degree above Zero
ar_5808.scr-642.09-649.79-B	but after that it will get colder they said it will snow again , approximately one or something above zero
ar_5808.scr-649.73-651.92-A	hmmm
ar_5808.scr-651.69-653.62-B	so the person is becoming
ar_5808.scr-654.07-664.47-B	of course also it seems to me that it is make me tired is the day is short so the daylight is shorter
ar_5808.scr-664.65-665.17-A	hmm
ar_5808.scr-665.70-677.46-B	i mean that's what makes the person feels i mean psychologically feels the light shortening
ar_5808.scr-677.67-678.11-A	hmm
ar_5808.scr-678.27-678.81-B	(( )) 
ar_5808.scr-679.46-682.15-A	then also when the person is
ar_5838.scr-884.89-887.29-B	happy environment
ar_5838.scr-887.94-892.82-B	i go and take the heat and put it in a jug and take it to the gas station to make it re-fighting
ar_5838.scr-893.23-893.64-A	hmm
ar_5838.scr-894.01-894.87-B	are you paying attention
ar_5838.scr-895.25-897.28-A	but when you come to the oil change
ar_5838.scr-897.43-897.93-B	hmm
ar_5838.scr-898.19-899.64-A	you open the filter  right
ar_5838.scr-900.15-901.02-B	yeah or must
ar_5838.scr-901.27-901.98-A	must
ar_5838.scr-901.29-902.45-B	must change the filter
ar_5838.scr-902.55-906.66-A	then you put the new filter then you put the three
ar_5838.scr-906.79-907.22-B	ya
ar_5838.scr-907.29-907.71-A	but
ar_5838.scr-907.87-908.29-B	Oh
ar_5838.scr-908.58-909.05-A	No
ar_5838.scr-909.30-909.83-B	or what
ar_5838.scr-909.56-911.55-A	that's why I'm telling you don't take three and take three and half
ar_5838.scr-911.79-912.30-B	why
ar_5838.scr-912.42-914.22-A	that's what happens when you put the new filter
ar_5838.scr-914.38-914.79-B	umm
ar_5838.scr-914.42-915.74-A	the filter would be empty
ar_5838.scr-915.83-916.30-B	umm
ar_5838.scr-917.37-922.56-A	so what , say so to make sure that all the oil is going away after the filter has been uninstalled turn on the engine
ar_5838.scr-923.40-927.71-A	you will find the pump tray taking the little oil that has stayed and shoot it outside
ar_5838.scr-927.57-932.64-B	no this is risky that you turn on the engine and leave it , some people are doing
ar_5838.scr-930.98-935.24-A	no it is just for seconds
ar_5838.scr-935.57-939.68-B	yes but there are people who do something to avoid the risk
ar_5838.scr-940.00-942.43-B	turn it on and there is no oil even for seconds
ar_5838.scr-943.12-947.19-B	they put it after the oil get emptied for good
ar_5838.scr-947.12-947.40-A	hmm
ar_5838.scr-947.95-956.03-B	he goes and bring the cord like new one and he throw it and he opens the hole to empty it also
ar_5838.scr-956.19-957.56-A	no no no
ar_5838.scr-957.20-960.16-B	he pulls out the dirt and the old and all with the new
ar_5838.scr-959.03-965.36-A	no if you want to do like that there is something called engine flush
ar_5838.scr-965.70-966.24-B	umm
ar_5838.scr-966.28-967.17-A	it's called dank
ar_5838.scr-967.44-967.93-B	umm
ar_5838.scr-967.84-970.03-A	you will find a quarter of a gallon that is like gas
ar_5838.scr-969.27-970.71-B	umm
ar_5838.scr-970.65-973.37-A	not only gas but like a chemical gas, liquid
ar_5838.scr-972.14-974.95-B	umm
ar_5838.scr-974.51-979.94-A	before you change the oil you pour it inside the motor and start the engine for fifteen minutes
ar_5838.scr-979.99-980.52-B	umm
ar_5838.scr-980.19-982.27-A	the chemical will clean the whole line for you
ar_5838.scr-982.46-983.35-B	umm
ar_5838.scr-982.99-987.28-A	and clean the dirt inside the engine, after that change the oil you will find that it all drained
ar_5838.scr-988.74-989.22-B	yeah
ar_5838.scr-988.87-989.32-A	(( )) 
ar_5838.scr-989.38-989.94-B	umm
ar_5838.scr-989.82-996.27-A	so anyway when you remove the filter and put a new filter, and put the oil you must turn the engine on for fifteen seconds
ar_5838.scr-996.34-997.02-B	umm
ar_5838.scr-996.81-1001.38-A	because all the oil will be mixed with each other and it will hit all the lines
ar_5838.scr-1001.42-1002.10-B	umm
ar_5838.scr-1001.83-1006.11-A	then it will enter the filter, then you measure the oil you will find it is one half less
ar_5838.scr-1006.61-1008.41-B	umm
ar_5838.scr-1008.62-1011.06-A	that's why I am telling you to cut its half, I mean this is the minimum
ar_5838.scr-1011.83-1012.41-B	hmm
ar_5838.scr-1012.66-1014.38-A	do you know that I installed a motor by myself
ar_5838.scr-1014.54-1016.52-B	installed the motor
ar_5838.scr-1016.48-1017.06-A	yes
ar_5838.scr-1017.02-1017.61-B	wow
ar_5838.scr-1018.12-1020.30-A	I started to do few mechanical things
ar_5838.scr-1020.87-1021.35-B	umm
ar_5838.scr-1021.64-1022.32-A	I change the brake
ar_5838.scr-1022.95-1023.39-B	umm
ar_5838.scr-1023.25-1025.97-A	I do motors, I installed a motor already
ar_5838.scr-1026.73-1030.89-B	no I never did a motor, but the brake is easy for me
ar_5838.scr-1031.43-1033.12-B	belts are easy
ar_5838.scr-1033.28-1033.72-A	umm
ar_5838.scr-1033.79-1036.01-B	radiator is easy, all this I did it before that

ar_5838.scr-1043.25-1044.70-B	oh yeah that is very easy
ar_5838.scr-1044.80-1045.58-A	it needs welding
ar_5838.scr-1046.10-1047.63-B	there is no welding here boss, no
ar_5838.scr-1047.22-1048.46-A	ah if there is no welding then fine
