ar_4150.scr-1192.20-1197.72-B1	what for?
ar_4150.scr-1198.12-1205.66-A	what a coward this girl has never talked to anyone but her father no one knows her in this world
ar_4150.scr-1198.46-1199.95-B1	So they got into a dispute and...
ar_4150.scr-1202.06-1204.52-B1	Exactly {laugh}, basically yeah {laugh}.
ar_4150.scr-1205.91-1220.29-B1	an unknown identity and a disaster and then... So what just matters is that she called me and kept talking to me for half an hour asking me about what is she supposed to do or not to do, so of course if I told her... I mean for example I told her that's it, if they divorced me, I mean basically there is...
ar_4150.scr-1207.81-1208.69-A	unknown
ar_4150.scr-1215.64-1216.65-A	and of that
ar_4150.scr-1220.61-1230.25-B1	so i told her"no, that's perfect, we have it here and it's perfect. it's the greatest in the world and i convinced her, they made up in the end, after
ar_4150.scr-1219.45-1224.61-A	laugh
ar_4150.scr-1228.32-1231.89-A	that means Yosri is like European among his brothers
ar_4150.scr-1232.29-1234.23-B1	European of course, very European.
ar_4150.scr-1233.31-1235.13-A	because you had a great start
ar_4150.scr-1235.37-1241.66-B1	yes, and basically who does she hang out with?, with Sherif Zenhom and Ahmad Kareem, those are all she knows, Sherine, Zenhom
ar_4150.scr-1241.14-1245.35-A	they know her then, nobody knows this girl in the world
ar_4150.scr-1243.35-1244.46-B1	yes they know her
ar_4150.scr-1245.54-1251.77-B1	no, turns out she said to me, who do i hang out with?, i'm hanging out with good guys, i'm hanging out with Sherif Zenhom, Ahmad Kareem and Ashraf AlGazaierly
ar_4150.scr-1246.17-1246.78-A	NA
ar_4150.scr-1252.48-1254.72-A	so what is it that had her standing with Shareef Zenhum and Ahmed Kareem and so and so?
ar_4150.scr-1255.77-1257.89-B1	that's it, so she's the type they'd be proud of, so basically
ar_4150.scr-1257.45-1259.20-A	just this one, so these are not a problem
ar_4150.scr-1259.66-1267.18-B1	it's not a problem for her, it's a problem for Sherif, one day she found me going to Montazah , she found me greeting Ashraf and
ar_4150.scr-1265.89-1267.47-A	they were surrounding her standing with her
ar_4150.scr-1267.79-1280.53-B1	yes, so i thought it must be that, well i realized that Yossry is on his own in the middle of the middle! they discarded him so they made up but what happened then, Doha delayed engagement when he found out there has been lots of fightig
ar_4150.scr-1272.13-1273.22-A	yes
ar_4150.scr-1280.88-1281.64-A	who's that

ar_4150.scr-1291.73-1303.56-B1	Yeah, so he found out that it's possible that we cancel the engagements, so he told you he will delay the engagement, since in Alexandria right now, everybody is saying that these.. and Qritam, that it won't work out between them and that they canceled the engagement.
ar_4150.scr-1292.44-1294.04-A	yes
ar_4150.scr-1304.82-1306.65-B1	This is the word that is spread around the country.
ar_4150.scr-1306.17-1308.21-A	It seems that the operation will finish
ar_4150.scr-1308.97-1317.92-B1	well, no but honestly after this fight, between the two of us, the guy used to treat her very bad, he didn't take care of her and sometimes he wouldn't see her or speak to her for a week!

ar_4150.scr-1317.31-1323.94-A	OK and OK and get engaged to her why then each one go alone they know each other to get attached real strange

ar_4542.scr-251.93-252.42-A	yes
ar_4542.scr-252.96-261.39-B	I want to take your opinion but its favoring won't work to do what here I am ready to take kindergarten but of course Alzini what school will enter
ar_4542.scr-261.53-262.97-A	yes why it is
ar_4542.scr-262.59-265.05-B	while in
ar_4542.scr-263.07-266.18-A	why I mean the Muslim generation won't accept the Muslim generation won't accept
ar_4542.scr-265.58-270.69-B	the generation of Muslims should enter first year nursery rather than second year nursery
ar_4542.scr-271.14-271.47-A	okay
ar_4542.scr-272.75-273.42-A	{static}
ar_4542.scr-272.62-280.29-B	and I write a confirmation that I approve to enter first year nursery and the school is not required to make them enter the first grade because their age would be six years next year
ar_4542.scr-280.47-284.33-A	okay what is the problem that they enter for what I mean why
ar_4542.scr-281.03-281.35-B	-
ar_4542.scr-283.90-293.62-B	they are making it complicated since from the time I came they disgusted me I tried to make him enter I went to make him enter the first year nursery and they told me the study has begun and that does not work O master I want to pay all the expenses but he enter
ar_4542.scr-291.64-291.88-A	M!
ar_4542.scr-294.79-295.52-A	M!
ar_4542.scr-293.97-301.22-B	there are no places, I tried to use my connections but it won't work
ar_4542.scr-301.26-301.60-A	mm
ar_4542.scr-301.49-309.03-B	they called and asked for the declaration to enter him in first pre-school without responsibility to enter him into first grade, so I said what do you think
ar_4542.scr-309.00-309.49-A	(())
ar_4542.scr-309.12-312.16-B	O Ayman it is over he has been accepted in AlZeni and I paid the expenses
ar_4542.scr-311.76-312.74-A	Okay that is it
ar_4542.scr-312.35-317.10-B	and I told them that he's 5 years old you could take him for the last year of kindergarten
ar_4542.scr-317.13-317.46-A	M!
ar_4542.scr-317.72-323.28-B	they said they agree according to his condition they study Arabic and Math and English, that's Al-Zieni the one near us here
ar_4542.scr-323.17-323.72-A	yes yes
ar_4542.scr-323.96-327.30-B	and then he transfers to another primary school
ar_4542.scr-327.47-331.98-A	yeah so either way whether he goes to Al-Zieni or a kindergarten so..
ar_4542.scr-331.04-331.51-B	yeah
ar_4542.scr-331.57-334.81-B	so I don't know what do you think
ar_4542.scr-334.59-341.65-A	I think leave him there so that if it all goes well he could start primary school if it doesn't happen he goes to any other primary school here it's all the same
ar_4542.scr-342.57-343.58-A	I mean if we..
ar_4542.scr-342.80-346.24-B	the difference has gone from seven hundred to one hundred and fifty
ar_4542.scr-347.21-355.10-A	it's not about the money that's not important the thing is he has a place there and has a priority to go
ar_4542.scr-346.90-349.58-B	yes
ar_4542.scr-354.72-359.21-B	but he'll enter first grade at seven years, what's wrong with that
ar_4542.scr-357.37-360.93-A	no if they don't let him in next year I'll take him to an outside school and that's it
ar_4542.scr-361.44-366.80-B	so if the connection doesn't work, I'll pay for him to enter first preschool
ar_4542.scr-367.18-369.53-A	try first and that's it
ar_4542.scr-369.16-370.17-B	so what if it doesn't happen
ar_4542.scr-369.83-372.31-A	so now if they
ar_4542.scr-370.50-372.87-B	you know the spending should be paid before school
ar_4542.scr-372.77-378.61-A	let me finish if they got him first year kindergarten he should finish to
ar_4542.scr-375.12-375.43-B	yes
ar_4542.scr-377.78-381.56-B	will enter second year kindergarten but in one case
ar_4542.scr-380.02-380.40-A	yes
ar_4542.scr-381.51-381.92-A	yes
ar_4542.scr-382.08-388.65-B	if there is a place at mid year for a kid to withdraw as he is leaving or got out of school
ar_4542.scr-388.75-390.01-A	they go and move him from kindergarten again
ar_4542.scr-389.10-390.69-B	this of course is what circumstance
ar_4542.scr-390.65-391.61-A	they move him to another kindergarten
ar_4542.scr-391.96-393.00-B	yes this yes
ar_4542.scr-393.09-393.55-A	yes
ar_4542.scr-393.66-400.28-B	also he said first grade also I mean he is going next year if there is such a thing
ar_4542.scr-401.69-406.91-A	I mean if he continued he might finish first kindergarten then enter first grade if there is vacancy
ar_4542.scr-407.11-415.00-B	yes  this is a weak choice I mean they want to make me admit to let go their responsibility so that I don't go and say how won't he enter first grade
ar_4542.scr-412.24-412.70-A	mm
ar_4542.scr-415.19-418.74-A	OK look at the favoring and get rid of this issue pay a little extra
ar_4542.scr-418.03-419.59-B	what if the connections didn't work
ar_4542.scr-420.07-420.33-A	what
ar_4542.scr-420.36-422.96-B	get him first year or what to do
ar_4542.scr-422.99-425.00-A	I mean let them even pay extra money it's not a problem
ar_4542.scr-425.39-425.86-B	What
ar_4542.scr-425.77-427.66-A	Make them pay some extra money no problem
ar_4542.scr-428.13-434.53-B	I wish it was this simple I told you I went there when I first came to get him into KG 1 and pay the expenses even if he doesn't show up
ar_4542.scr-433.47-433.76-A	mm
ar_4542.scr-434.79-435.16-A	yeah
ar_4542.scr-435.06-437.68-B	they didn't accept they're complicating it so much really I don't know why
ar_4542.scr-437.85-440.50-A	yeah they're the only ones that..
ar_4542.scr-439.89-445.93-B	If I knew that before we came they would've paid in advance and reserved him a place but we didn't know
ar_4542.scr-445.90-447.87-A	we knew that things will go this way
ar_4542.scr-448.00-448.33-B	yes
ar_4542.scr-448.33-451.31-A	can't
ar_4542.scr-451.03-456.46-B	What ! this is meant that if he doesn't catch first year of primary school next year ,you should out him and catch him for a new school
ar_4542.scr-457.01-462.29-A	yes I swear to God let them be together and that is it God make it easy we see a solution
ar_4542.scr-462.39-464.46-B	I mean we enter it
ar_4542.scr-464.03-467.21-A	maybe till I come we find a solution or so
ar_4542.scr-467.66-468.02-B	mm
ar_4542.scr-468.02-471.82-A	I mean if we take him out now it'll be a problem that we might not be able to get him in again
ar_4542.scr-472.18-472.57-B	Yes!
ar_4542.scr-472.62-476.45-A	its there we found a chance that we get him and will move on
ar_4542.scr-476.96-477.61-B	How?
ar_4542.scr-477.92-481.34-A	I don't understand he is there in school
ar_4542.scr-480.92-482.94-B	yes I mean it there
ar_4542.scr-482.89-488.91-A	It's available and that's all. The thing that after he goes to school next year will be easier, easier than you take him from the beginning
ar_4542.scr-489.13-491.30-B	OK if they insist that I write this admission
ar_4542.scr-491.12-492.87-A	OK you will write as you have to get him in
ar_4542.scr-493.33-493.63-B	yes
ar_4542.scr-493.65-499.79-A	but you try as much as you can I mean not to write the admission and such things to enter and get money and show it
ar_4542.scr-499.14-501.58-B	the topic is really annoying
ar_4542.scr-501.12-505.23-A	of course I don't want to talk offer them if you pay even once or twice it won't be a problem
ar_4542.scr-505.63-506.01-B	What is this
ar_4542.scr-506.16-509.77-A	Means you had to offer to them to pay a thousand pound and nothing more, that means make it thousand instead of even hundred
ar_4542.scr-510.97-519.55-B	they don't accept this man he is a man I mean the Islamic people are the lying master
ar_4542.scr-520.00-523.18-A	yes who who the president of them who knows him I know there isn't

ar_4751.scr-443.13-445.62-B	(non arabic)
ar_4751.scr-443.29-452.43-A	So what you're feeling expatriation. Your country is yours. Even when like you're living in Saudi Arabia, it's an Arabic country and everything, but you still feel like stranger, right

ar_4751.scr-466.52-479.17-A	Even when you're feeling that you're in your county, your friends and family and people and all that... but we need to see it from the money side
ar_4751.scr-478.61-480.77-B	m
ar_4751.scr-479.20-485.72-A	You know what i'm saying... May God make it easy in the future. God willing we can go to Egypt and stay and live there
ar_4751.scr-484.26-494.40-B	go their relieved I mean the most important thing is you come with money to start a project in Egypt and live in a clean house and place and that is it
ar_4751.scr-487.44-496.07-A	yes God make it easy if God wants if God wants
ar_4751.scr-495.99-503.32-B	here we all work for that in the end to come and live well also because Egypt is very nice but needs money
ar_4751.scr-498.28-506.11-A	Yeah but you used to have a pharmacy in Egypt, Hussien
ar_4751.scr-506.20-510.46-B	My pharmacy was weak, Mohammad... It' wasn't enough
ar_4751.scr-508.63-511.10-A	Don't work with means don't with with who you mean
ar_4751.scr-510.74-516.03-B	Don't you want an apartment and car and whatever else... It's already limited to live only...

ar_4751.scr-520.81-523.23-A	you have an apartment
ar_4751.scr-522.50-533.01-B	I mean you want to achieve a dream about a comfortable future and to get whatever you want and such so you're working hard now
ar_4751.scr-530.79-535.49-A	mm
ar_4751.scr-533.08-545.61-B	So later on you will be comfortable, but if you were comfortable now so then how will you get the money. Do you want to marry your daughter... well anything in the future you will need money

ar_4751.scr-545.90-550.96-B	where will you bring the money from, the Pharmacy won't earn this much
ar_4751.scr-549.60-556.76-A	now the place didn't get any better she didn't work enough, tell her
ar_4751.scr-555.34-560.77-B	of course it's better thanks God, she didn't drop by when she traveled
ar_4751.scr-560.58-560.89-A	m!
ar_4751.scr-560.89-567.11-B	she started to improve, of course her income is sufficient for home expenses in Egypt
ar_4751.scr-566.73-568.92-A	m! but I need something from him.
ar_4751.scr-567.91-574.90-B	but it's not enough for securing your future, any phramacy earns about 700 pounds
ar_4751.scr-574.99-575.75-A	um!
ar_4751.scr-575.80-577.37-B	it'd be good..
ar_4751.scr-577.38-577.94-A	how much
ar_4751.scr-577.99-580.30-B	of course a 1000 is the top

ar_4751.scr-585.57-587.23-B	1000 pounds a day is good
ar_4751.scr-587.39-587.86-A	yes!
ar_4751.scr-588.19-591.20-B	it makes about six thousand per month
ar_4751.scr-591.44-592.31-A	oh!
ar_4751.scr-592.20-598.41-B	fair enough, you will spend about one or two thousands and save the rest, that would be appropiate
ar_4751.scr-598.70-599.08-A	oh!
ar_4751.scr-598.98-607.47-B	where can you find a pharmacy  in the town center and for only quarter of a million? the prices in Egypt now are half a million and one million
ar_4751.scr-607.34-607.67-A	um!
ar_4751.scr-607.86-613.75-B	you will hear the prices, but if you want to buy  a pharmacy in an inadequate area you will find a lot for 50 or 60 thousand
ar_4751.scr-613.92-616.65-A	yeah but pharmacies are..
ar_4751.scr-614.93-618.46-B	you see, in New Tanta he wanted to sell it for half a million

ar_4751.scr-665.07-669.03-B	of course it's possible to start a company
ar_4751.scr-667.81-679.21-A	start a company instead of paying half a million in a pharmacy a store so three or four start a company for two three four million pounds you get a company and an office and import medicine from any where

ar_4751.scr-681.19-682.20-A	I wish

ar_4778.scr-616.67-621.69-A	I swear I am not kidding it is it is to the extent that I said OK she should have taken my car instead of staying
ar_4778.scr-622.58-623.35-B	laugh
ar_4778.scr-622.66-624.12-A	Then I said let's avoid the problems anyway
ar_4778.scr-624.57-626.32-B	Sure not  ((balA$ menha))  But what is it
ar_4778.scr-626.71-626.94-A	Yeah!
ar_4778.scr-626.71-627.62-B	No she acts as beetle then
ar_4778.scr-627.95-631.52-A	yes a hippie, she is saying I can't move in Egypt without a car
ar_4778.scr-632.60-633.11-B	NA
ar_4778.scr-632.30-634.59-A	and between me and you what was said is right but
ar_4778.scr-634.32-635.02-B	(( ))
ar_4778.scr-634.63-638.67-A	also the solution is to spend five thousand pound to rent a car is also strange
ar_4778.scr-640.18-644.95-B	yeah, No I mean should we take the newer
ar_4778.scr-645.00-647.66-B	I mean no, I don't know
ar_4778.scr-646.98-652.91-A	yeah if you started to think like say, I don't know how much Alaa earns
ar_4778.scr-653.30-655.71-A	but, that Alae take ten thousand riyals for example
ar_4778.scr-656.17-660.35-A	yeah, he told you for example this five thousand pound are the salary of half month, is not a problem
ar_4778.scr-662.01-662.88-B	you think
ar_4778.scr-662.68-664.41-A	for example, I on't know
ar_4778.scr-664.55-665.49-B	Mm! it is possible sure
ar_4778.scr-665.86-667.61-B	Possible yeah! sure this is possible possible

ar_4778.scr-670.80-671.59-B	Maybe (( ))
ar_4778.scr-669.78-677.97-A	But yeah! anyway or not uh! I mean I guess she could have bought a car for example in God's will for twenty thousand and could have sold it at the end of the period and she would have lost in it --
ar_4778.scr-678.34-680.91-A	not more than a thousand i mean she takes the rest
ar_4778.scr-680.13-680.34-B	yeah
ar_4778.scr-680.62-686.97-B	surely she could have taken any car from anyone but not 5000 pounds I don't know I don't know
ar_4778.scr-686.89-693.29-A	I'm just saying that somethings cannot be taken as it is

ar_4899.scr-1150.46-1151.01-B	distortion
ar_4899.scr-1150.21-1159.67-A	what staying with her I mean we try to get her out of what she is in we try to make her learn a thing or do anything
ar_4899.scr-1160.72-1161.46-B	i really wish
ar_4899.scr-1160.58-1164.29-A	because in Egypt she has no chance
ar_4899.scr-1163.81-1164.36-B	umm!
ar_4899.scr-1164.56-1174.89-B	but take her in a good way and encourage not as life there I mean its hard and the one should be in it
ar_4899.scr-1175.46-1177.71-B	tense and she won't take it easily
ar_4899.scr-1177.94-1178.38-A	m
ar_4899.scr-1178.61-1186.96-B	what what consider one still I mean at the start it didn't cost a thing its of her mental energy
ar_4899.scr-1187.44-1187.86-A	mm!mm!

ar_4899.scr-1194.88-1195.38-A	m
ar_4899.scr-1195.66-1197.71-B	what I noticed on her that she has fear inside
ar_4899.scr-1198.56-1199.64-B	she can't face it
ar_4899.scr-1198.26-1214.69-A	m also her marriage and divorce in two weeks ruined it for her I mean many people that I know tried to get one soon as they knew she was divorced of course we tell them that from the start
ar_4899.scr-1214.53-1215.86-B	of course they must know
ar_4899.scr-1215.64-1217.03-A	change their minds immediately
ar_4899.scr-1217.78-1219.46-A	and even
ar_4899.scr-1220.39-1226.21-A	her readiness, didn't god compensate her with other things for what she had
ar_4899.scr-1226.62-1232.14-A	I mean there are people that God give beauty and take smartness of them and people that are smart and with no beauty

ar_4899.scr-1251.38-1251.72-B	mm

ar_4899.scr-1263.36-1264.47-A	then what?
ar_4899.scr-1263.88-1269.31-B	then, divorce isn't the main obstacle, it's an obstacle but
ar_4899.scr-1268.86-1272.72-A	we didn't tell him, he refused without even knowing
ar_4899.scr-1271.86-1281.54-B	OK, but believe me her communication skills, she doesn't have what he asked for, that's her obstacle
ar_4899.scr-1280.08-1280.54-A	mm
ar_4899.scr-1282.09-1292.19-B	they way she acts with people around her, she's good at some stuff ..laziness and all that stuff ..if i was him , even if she was divorced she will get her chance
ar_4899.scr-1292.71-1294.28-B	that's the problem, she has to get rid of this

ar_4899.scr-1440.78-1449.04-B	Yes, from now till the story comes, there is nothing from before, but the idea of course, is based on it that you will stay here... That's a different topic
ar_4899.scr-1448.41-1448.81-A	umm
ar_4899.scr-1449.26-1449.78-A	yeah
ar_4899.scr-1450.31-1452.97-B	have you thought  of this
ar_4899.scr-1452.36-1462.72-A	these are the things that of the ideas that come to me to do this I mean there is a couple of thins I don't want to stay at my work i mean
ar_4899.scr-1462.16-1464.78-B	OK I want to acra- tell you something you are now
ar_4899.scr-1465.76-1469.64-B	Your job it supposed that it's income is good I think
ar_4899.scr-1470.09-1472.61-A	not not not the amount of work I get tired in
ar_4899.scr-1473.59-1475.03-A	I mean its tiring
ar_4899.scr-1474.09-1477.64-B	No but I mean for Egypt it will be very good of course
ar_4899.scr-1477.88-1479.79-A	yes as in Egypt there is no work for me at all
ar_4899.scr-1480.33-1487.24-B	OK about the issue of having a work or not having a work its income suppose you have a job there you won;'t have his money there
ar_4899.scr-1484.56-1484.89-A	M!
ar_4899.scr-1487.11-1499.11-A	yes I compare two things to get to Egypt and set at home not doing a thing and of course won't have income to spend on my self or stay here and work like a donkey and can
ar_4899.scr-1498.78-1503.66-B	No, it still my question is on its way, i want to know to do save those money or you don't

ar_4899.scr-1505.39-1507.51-B	But why not? This is the biggest mistake you're making
ar_4899.scr-1507.84-1508.26-A	na
ar_4899.scr-1507.91-1509.76-B	you know since you went you've been collecting
ar_4899.scr-1509.83-1510.38-A	Mhm!
ar_4899.scr-1510.53-1518.71-B	Long time ago you used to stay in Egypt with whatever you had at home, and study something you like and work on something that you like and still make money
ar_4899.scr-1515.97-1516.34-A	m
ar_4899.scr-1517.89-1521.94-A	Because I'm compensating for the years of deprivation which I lived in Saudi Arabia
ar_4899.scr-1522.91-1523.53-A	NA
ar_4899.scr-1523.06-1525.71-B	alright enough compensation how many years will you sit and compensate for in America
ar_4899.scr-1525.89-1531.59-A	since I finished college then five years almost

ar_4899.scr-1536.34-1537.14-A	yes
ar_4899.scr-1536.41-1540.41-B	Actually this idea I mean if I could do it I would have done it too since long ago
ar_4899.scr-1540.72-1541.19-A	m
ar_4899.scr-1541.03-1550.99-B	America America but what matters the idea that at the time we are in as work is disgusting and life isn't easy as it used to be the one find an easy job
ar_4899.scr-1550.97-1551.34-A	m
ar_4899.scr-1551.12-1556.19-B	and its return is good then find time to himself and this all doesn't exist in life its tough and so
ar_4899.scr-1554.89-1555.29-A	yes
ar_4899.scr-1556.42-1556.83-A	m
ar_4899.scr-1556.28-1560.92-B	I wish i did something like that, to save lots of money and work hard at first, then i rest

ar_4899.scr-1561.22-1564.88-A	OK the Arab countries don't take anymore or what
ar_4899.scr-1566.28-1569.41-B	labakasar
ar_4899.scr-1569.67-1570.19-A	mim
ar_4899.scr-1570.71-1573.62-B	and the humiliation and the oppression of Egyptians and such things
ar_4899.scr-1572.53-1576.84-A	wbaitalabwa
ar_4899.scr-1577.38-1578.88-B	as now I have many
ar_4899.scr-1579.09-1583.88-A	matab
ar_4899.scr-1584.11-1586.96-B	anakaan
ar_4899.scr-1586.67-1587.12-A	mim
ar_4899.scr-1588.12-1593.94-B	labaisa
ar_4899.scr-1594.33-1597.42-B	and- enough with this compensation story
ar_4899.scr-1597.79-1598.19-A	m!
ar_4899.scr-1597.94-1600.81-B	and they will benefit you even right here- I mean
ar_4899.scr-1601.46-1604.33-B	I don't know, of course I don't know the numbers but in general
ar_4899.scr-1603.83-1610.12-A	but also saving I get back to ask my self I mean all the peopel I ask
ar_4899.scr-1607.62-1607.97-B	m!
ar_4899.scr-1611.03-1611.81-A	and I
ar_4899.scr-1611.22-1616.16-B	actually look, I also discovered something in this memorizing topic, of course I memorize as well but I'm not strong or anything
ar_4899.scr-1616.46-1616.83-A	m!
ar_4899.scr-1616.34-1621.88-B	but there is something I read about people talking about memory and thinking and these things I mean
ar_4899.scr-1618.09-1618.28-A	m!
ar_4899.scr-1622.01-1633.06-B	the studies say, and I've tried it and surely you have tried it, that for the person there is the different of the earth and the heavens between memorizing something which you like and you are into, and something you dislike and you are not into and don't understand
ar_4899.scr-1629.19-1629.59-A	m
ar_4899.scr-1633.22-1633.69-A	Yes!
ar_4899.scr-1634.06-1637.04-B	so it means the condition is that you understand it and like it
ar_4899.scr-1637.14-1637.58-A	Yes!
ar_4899.scr-1637.44-1639.46-B	These two make you memorize air
ar_4899.scr-1639.61-1640.17-A	right
ar_4899.scr-1640.46-1646.38-B	but if you don't understand it or dislike it then you are digging a hole in a rock
ar_4899.scr-1643.11-1643.71-A	mm
ar_4899.scr-1645.83-1647.88-A	this is right
ar_4899.scr-1647.66-1654.09-B	if you are I tried this a lot he is calm and happy of this topic as he walks with me nice
ar_4899.scr-1651.04-1651.42-A	mm
ar_4899.scr-1654.22-1654.62-A	Yes!
ar_4899.scr-1656.34-1656.67-A	m!
ar_4899.scr-1654.53-1659.78-B	and he took it forcefully like this, and against my will as if I were Hieroglyphs
ar_4899.scr-1659.91-1660.41-A	Yes!
ar_4899.scr-1660.67-1662.89-B	so this is not the problem if you indeed like it

ar_4899.scr-1663.74-1664.96-B	-- you will find yourself memorizing it easier

ar_5531.scr-372.37-375.49-A	like Sharm El Sheikh or whatever these kind of stuff
