ar_4530.scr-228.48-230.31-B	yes
ar_4530.scr-229.87-234.91-A	so it seems that it is because Khaled doesn't know anything about what is between you and the university vice president regarding to that subject

ar_4530.scr-235.26-236.54-B	yes

ar_4530.scr-246.33-247.91-A	what, so
ar_4530.scr-248.98-256.06-A	so I wish if Dr. Hussam and the university vice president would see what is the situation exactly and tell you what it is exactly for you to understand, so I understood that Ismael surely
ar_4530.scr-254.89-255.83-B	umm
ar_4530.scr-256.35-258.93-A	said something about your request from him

ar_4530.scr-259.24-260.11-B	
ar_4530.scr-259.78-263.85-A	that I extend a bit, and it becomes six months, and he sent you to the university vice president, and so on of this subject
ar_4530.scr-264.00-264.43-B	mhm
ar_4530.scr-265.22-265.80-A	Be careful.

ar_4530.scr-274.24-275.74-B	umm
ar_4530.scr-274.37-279.00-A	that the other for example, or if I was not able, you will explain to him how the other is agreeing, or does not mind and so on
ar_4530.scr-278.78-285.17-B	nah, leave it on me, besides that it is done slowly, it will go slowly, he he he gives it to Ismael, not me
ar_4530.scr-280.87-281.69-A	yes
ar_4530.scr-283.74-284.37-A	to Ismael
ar_4530.scr-285.02-285.76-A	yes like that
ar_4530.scr-285.89-289.83-B	so you understand that he is the one who will tell Ismael, my interfere in between will mean that there is something in relation
ar_4530.scr-289.94-291.13-A	yes exactly
ar_4530.scr-290.87-295.78-B	no but I want it to come naturally, like "by the way" do you understand?
ar_4530.scr-294.96-296.46-A	yes, OK
ar_4530.scr-296.26-297.44-B	yes, he hints it

ar_4530.scr-300.06-305.94-B	yes, well I told him the truth, I I I do not know what to do, it seems that he wants to stay, and I do not know what to do, we want him back, and he still wants to stay as it seems
ar_4530.scr-306.15-306.50-A	yes
ar_4530.scr-306.13-308.09-B	so a subject like this, will end with him staying
ar_4530.scr-308.56-308.91-A	yes
ar_4530.scr-309.27-317.27-B	so he laughed and said do not try, it means he does not want to go back, I told him no he does not want to, so what to do, keep the papers come and go just like that, I mean for two, three, or four months period
ar_4530.scr-316.54-319.32-A	this subject is between him and you, between you and him in some cozy place or

ar_4718.scr-910.09-913.64-A	The place I'm living in is calm.
ar_4718.scr-914.33-918.99-A	there is no noise most of my house neighbors are old residents so this is an advantage to be frank, they do not make noise
ar_4718.scr-919.19-919.50-B	[background] 
ar_4718.scr-919.79-920.10-A	I .. the
ar_4718.scr-920.05-920.37-B	umm
ar_4718.scr-920.08-923.99-A	I got very tired at the beginning, this is what I didn't tell you about, that I got very tired at the beginning to find a place
ar_4718.scr-924.08-926.95-A	because I kept moving from one place to another, and the distances here are wide
ar_4718.scr-926.19-927.02-B	it is a must of course
ar_4718.scr-927.70-928.19-A	I mean
ar_4718.scr-927.89-928.74-B	it's a must of course
ar_4718.scr-928.94-932.03-A	like two hundred kilometers width, or one hundred fifty kilometers width
ar_4718.scr-932.71-933.49-A	so
ar_4718.scr-932.71-933.68-B	must be like that
ar_4718.scr-933.92-934.61-A	so it means
ar_4718.scr-935.25-936.72-B	this is something very normal Omar
ar_4718.scr-936.58-937.87-A	yes and the feature
ar_4718.scr-937.35-938.46-B	when someone comes, what?
ar_4718.scr-938.78-941.65-B	when person comes, for example when I go to Isma'iliyah
ar_4718.scr-941.89-944.00-B	I move from one hotel to another, and from one room to another
ar_4718.scr-944.28-945.83-B	and I stay for four days
ar_4718.scr-944.35-946.99-A	but the point is that you keep spending, and what? I was
ar_4718.scr-947.02-950.73-A	at the beginning, bothered, I mean I .. these are twenty two hours
ar_4718.scr-951.10-954.26-A	mama didn't sleep for three days because you

ar_4718.scr-964.06-966.76-B	I heard that you at the beginning go to ..
ar_4718.scr-967.06-970.08-B	go to South pole and after that you come back again, or the North pole? or what?
ar_4718.scr-969.33-973.22-A	no no no I stayed in New york and after that from New York to here
ar_4718.scr-973.21-975.51-A	so both are inside America, six and half hours in plane
ar_4718.scr-975.82-977.47-A	which means more far than from England to Egypt
ar_4718.scr-977.20-978.34-B	OK
ar_4718.scr-977.97-978.57-A	and it differed
ar_4718.scr-978.39-979.62-B	well I heard from other people
ar_4718.scr-978.55-979.47-A	three hours timing

ar_4718.scr-990.68-992.20-A	no no no no no no
ar_4718.scr-991.38-992.53-B	the North pole and
ar_4718.scr-992.52-993.68-A	then the process would be too wide
ar_4718.scr-992.87-994.06-B	(( )) 
ar_4718.scr-993.78-994.96-A	what? became wide a little because of them
